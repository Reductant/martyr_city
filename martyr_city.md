## AUTHOR’S NOTE

I have been asked to provide a guide to the pronunciation of the names in this book. However, since the nation of Ramestan, and Rami, the language of its people, are wholly fictional, I am willing to go along with whatever sounds good in the reader’s own head. The one exception is the name Malaf, which must be pronounced with each *a* short, as in *badass*.

>
> **ABEEJ A:** Hello?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Emergency! Crisis!
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Not joking!
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Come on! Please answer!!!
>
> **ABEEJ A:** @Qaseh: I know the rules are we don’t call each other over an open phone line, but I swear if you don’t reply right now that’s what I’ll do.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** @Boraz @Irooj: Any of you, come on! @Tusham: Hello?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** COME ON!
>
> **10.49 PM: QASEH J JOINS CONVERSATION**
>
> **QASEH J:** Evening, comrade! What’s on your mind?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** We have an emergency.
>
> **QASEH J:** I’m not going to fix your computer.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** @Qaseh: I’m not kidding! People are in danger.
>
> **QASEH J:** What’s going on?
>
> **QASEH J:** Are you all right?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** I am fine. But there’s a problem. Before I go on, I just want to check: it really \*is\* safe to talk here, right?

The person who had opened the conversation was Abeej Abaadi. The file the government had on him was not substantially thicker than it would have been on any other citizen. He was an Ez Raam native, a web developer, self-employed. A graduate of Ez Raam’s Technical University. Abeej’s name and surname each began with the first and second letters of the Rami alphabet. The name almost guaranteed him a position at the top of each of his friends’ list of contacts. It condemned him to a life of butt-dials, mis-sent texts and hour-long unintended voicemail messages.

Abeej Abaadi only became involved in the affair because his was the name one picked when one only had seconds to cry for help.

The other person in this conversation: Qaseh Jomkhouri. Also an Ez Raam native. Qaseh worked as a network engineer in one of Ez Raam’s biggest insurance companies.

Qaseh was a technical man, good at his job; but he had other areas of expertise.

Qaseh was someone you went to if you had a very specific kind of problem.

> **QASEH J:** \*Safe?\* That depends on your threat model. Any conversation can be monitored. It’s a question of resources. Time. Computing power. So: who are you afraid might be listening?
>
> **10.51 PM: IROOJ R JOINS CONVERSATION**
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Police. Government. Anyone.
>
> **IROOJ R:** @Abeej: Hey Abeej! What’s all this about?
>
> **QASEH J:** @Abeej: Police? Government? \*Anyone??\*
>
> **QASEH J:** Okay, assuming this isn’t just melodrama, you’ve got my full attention.
>
> **QASEH J:** @Irooj: Glad you could join us for this late-night chat.
>
> **QASEH J:** @Abeej: the short answer is: we don’t know, but probably pretty safe. I don’t think we can talk over a network and be more private than we are right now.
>
>**QASEH J:** No word of vVhisper transcripts used as evidence in courts. And the Enemy hasn’t made any move to outlaw it. Probably because its usage is so small it’s beneath their notice.
>
>**IROOJ R:** Or because it’s completely compromised and they’re reading every word we write. ;)
>
>**QASEH J:** @Abeej: If you’re really worried, why not do this face-to-face? I can be free tomorrow.
>
>**QASEH J:** @Irooj: Behave.
>
>**IROOJ R:** :P

Irooj Robhidan: in-house graphic designer and web developer in a company that made air conditioning units. Resident in Ez Raam but originally from Ez Takhab in the south of the country. Her husband, Tusham Robhidan, lay beside her, his sleeping vastness illuminated blue-white in the glow of Irooj’s mobile.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Boraz Feroosh, a taxi driver, had pulled over his cab, turned off the engine, and was scrolling through the feed.

> **10.53 PM: BORAZ F JOINS CONVERSATION**
>
> **ABEEJ A:** This can’t wait till tomorrow.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Okay, I’ll say it here. Malaf has been arrested.
>
> **IROOJ R:** Oh shit. Let me wake up Tusham.

Malaf: it was the kind of name that dated you like a radioisotope dates a skeleton. It nailed your date of birth to that one summer in the 1980s (Western calendar), to the minor love interest in a TV show that resurrected a name from ancient literature and made it suddenly, briefly, much better known than it had been for over a thousand years. The result was a titanic shift in naming patterns that would supply material for demographers’ PhD theses for generations to come. In their thousands, young couples rushed to the registry offices and named their girls Malaf, realising only once the ink was dry that everyone else had had the same idea.

These days, it seemed that every other woman in her thirties was a Malaf. Each of the participants in the vVhisper chat knew several.

And yet no one – *no one* – asked which Malaf he was talking about.

> **QASEH J:** Okay. You know this how?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** She sent me a text.
>
> **QASEH J:** Time?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Maybe ten minutes before I messaged you. Just one Texxtor message, from Malaf’s phone. I’ll quote it here.
>
> > \> **MALAF S:** arrest help
>
> **ABEEJ A:** That’s the whole thing.
>
> **QASEH J:** Two words. I agree they’re not good words, but they could mean anything.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** I know, right? And... I mean, this is \*Malaf!\* When was the last time you last heard from her?
>
> **IROOJ R:** Years ago...
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Right. I didn’t know what to think. So I called her back. Someone picked up, but it wasn’t her. It was a man’s voice.
>
> **IROOJ R:** You think it was a cop?
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Yes. He asked who I was. I didn’t answer, just hung up.
>
> **QASEH J:** Good.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** But I think I could hear a woman in the background. It must have been Malaf. She was shouting something. No idea what.
>
> **IROOJ R:** Oh God, what has she done?
>
> **QASEH J:** Where are you, Abeej? Are you at home? I’m going to need the phone you received the text on.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Why?
>
> **QASEH J:** There’s some information I can pull off it. I might be able to do it remotely but I’ve never tried it before and now’s not the time to experiment. Can you come to my flat? My equipment is here.
>
> **11.00 PM: TUSHAM R JOINS CONVERSATION**
>
> **TUSHAM R:** Irooj just told me everything. We’re here to help.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** I’m just getting ready to leave now.
>
> **QASEH J:** Good. Be fast.
>
> **BORAZ F:** Hey. I’m in my cab now. Only just hearing about this. I can’t believe it. Malaf...
>
> **TUSHAM R:** @Boraz: Where are you?
>
> **BORAZ F:** @Tusham: North Kings Street, so near your place. Want me to pick you up on my way to Qaseh’s? I can be there in ten minutes.
>
> **TUSHAM R:** @Boraz: Good idea. We’ll be ready.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** @Qaseh: I’m heading for my car now. Bringing my phone and laptop. Need anything else?
>
> **QASEH J:** No. Get here quick, Abeej. Minutes count.
>
> **ABEEJ A:** Fast as I can.
>
> **11.02 PM: ABEEJ A LEAVES THE CONVERSATION**
>
> **BORAZ F:** Calling in sick with the company. They don’t like it, they can fire me. @Irooj @Tusham: See you in a bit. @Qaseh: A bit later.
>
> **QASEH J:** I’ll be waiting. Good luck.
>
> **11.03 PM: TUSHAM R LEAVES THE CONVERSATION**

>
> **QASEH J:** Yes?
>
> **IROOJ R:** Like I said, it’s been years...
>
> **IROOJ R:** Do you think she’ll be glad to see us?
>
> **QASEH J:** Why wouldn’t she be? We’re beautiful butterflies.
>
> **IROOJ R:** How silly of me to even ask.
>
> **11.04 PM: IROOJ R LEAVES THE CONVERSATION**

> **11.04 PM: CONVERSATION CLOSED**

One feature of vVhisper, a messaging app designed for anonymity, was that it deleted its closed conversations after a few minutes. By repeatedly writing random 1s and 0s over its own history file, it guaranteed that no trace of the text can be used as evidence if one of the participants’ phones is captured.

In a way that was a pity, because, later, after the blood and fear and death, the record would have provided a kind of solace.

Not one of the participants had pointed out that the most likely reason they hadn’t spoken with Malaf in years was that she wanted nothing further to do with them. Nobody had suggested that whatever happened to her was no longer their business. Nobody had asked if, by helping her, they might get themselves into trouble.

Once, years ago, they had been a team. And what the now-vanishing message log demonstrated was that, even though time had separated them, a team was what they remained.

And now, in aid of a fallen member, the team went to work.

## II

On the main highway out of Ez Raam, a 1.2-litre Pasham Sixty made its way west at a cool twenty km/h over the speed limit.

In choosing to drive at this speed, the car’s occupants – two women in long black gowns – had been faced with an optimisation problem: how to minimise the risk of being pulled over. Yes, they were breaking the speed limit, and the faster they went, the more likely it was that a cop would decide to chase them; but a vehicle driving *at* the speed limit, here, on this road, at this time of day, would soon find itself leading a snake of angry drivers many kilometres long. The sounds of their horns would be heard from here to the mountains. The Supreme Leader himself, in his hospital bed, would know where they were just by listening. Driving within the law here would be the height of suspicious activity.

There was a balance to be struck, and neither of the women was sure they’d hit it.

The same went for their outfits. The hoods of their shapeless black gowns were pulled tightly around their faces, sealing them almost airtight all the way around from chin to hairline. The Guards were a literal-minded bunch, and in case any of them happened to be on patrol, the women’s clothing was beyond reproach. At the same time, this was Ez Raam – hardly Las Vegas, but a hotbed of depraved modernity as far as many were concerned – and for some reason here were two women, young, attractive, dressed like they were going to a funeral.

Some people might see them and see nothing amiss. Others might see something else.

The woman in the passenger’s seat was in two minds about all this. True, there was no legal reason for the police to take an interest in them. But at the same time, she had the worrying feeling that they might as well have put a sign on the roof: WE ARE ACTING SUSPICIOUSLY, PLEASE SEARCH OUR VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY THE TRUNK.

At least thinking about this distracted her from how bad her seat was.

The driver noticed her squirming. “Comfy?”

“My back’s killing me.”

“Mine did too at the start, but now I’ve lost all feeling from the neck down. I’ve decided to frame that as a good thing.”

“Are we there yet?”

“Don’t worry. I’m sure the next few hours will just fly by.”

“No doubt.” The passenger scooted her bum forward on the seat as far as she could, then kicked off her shoes in the footwell and rested the bare soles of her feet on the warm plastic of the dashboard. “On the way back, I’m taking *their* car. The one with lumbar support.”

“Lumbar support is a bourgeois affectation. If you were truly class conscious you’d sit on a box.”

This remark was delivered in the drawling tones of one of their male confederates, who was travelling in another car up ahead – admittedly, a car with considerably better seating than the Sixty.

The car-sharing routine was yet another decision designed to maximise their chances. It was hard to get reliable data on the subject, but Ez Raamer folk wisdom suggested that a mixed-sex car was more likely stopped and searched, since it might be going to the kind of social situation where alcohol might be consumed. This was followed by men-only, with women-only being the safest. So, the logic went, if you absolutely had to move anything illegal, and you had a group of men and women at your disposal, it was better to bundle the women into the same car, and have them carry it.

The passenger thought about what would happen if they got pulled over. Knowing their luck, it wouldn’t be the kind of cop who could be waved away with a couple of large-denomination banknotes. No, this would be one of the true believers, someone who’d insist on checking thoroughly. He’d march them out of the car, maybe at gunpoint if they tried to talk their way out of it. And with them kneeling on the roadside, hands on their heads, he would look in the trunk.

There were a few items in there: binoculars, ear defenders, two-way radios, two two-person tents, a butane stove. These were heavy, and shifting them out of the way to get to the compartment underneath would be a pain. Maybe that would be enough to stop him.

Or maybe he’d unpack all of it, and get a good look at the compartment underneath.

The passenger of the Sixty had an organised mind, and liked to make lists. She had made a list of the other items in the trunk, and was running through it over and over.

*Money.*

Several fat stacks of banknotes. Used, non-consecutive bills. This didn’t add up to a huge amount, post-inflation, but it was more than a pair of demurely-dressed ladies would normally be carrying around with them. It would certainly raise eyebrows, raise questions in the mind of this imaginary police agent. Finding this, there would be no going back. His search would inevitably resume, and he would soon discover the next item on the list, which was:

*Vodka.*

Three 75 cl bottles thereof. Homemade, barely drinkable, in glass bottles that had once held olive oil.

Now why, asked the passenger’s internal father figure, would they have done something as foolish as bringing alcohol with them?

The answer was simply this: that they were going on an immensely long and difficult drive; that their journey would take them into the desert; that they would have to stay there for an as yet undetermined time; that they would have no comfort beyond the pleasure of one another’s company, which, let’s be honest, wasn’t saying much; and that all of these things would be made more bearable by the availability of booze. As to its illegality, that turned out to be a nonissue. The vodka was just the cherry on top of the hugely criminal cargo, which would pass as a mere afterthought on discovery of the next entry on her list, which was:

*A gun.*

Semi-automatic, brickish and heavy-looking. A subheading to this entry: several boxes of 9 mm ammunition. The boxes were marked *hollow-point*. The woman in the passenger’s seat didn’t know exactly what that meant, in practical terms, but didn’t expect that any adjective appearing on a box of bullets would be a synonym for *friendly* or *less lethal*.

*Money, vodka, a gun.*

She cycled through it endlessly. Some people repeated soothing mantras as a form of meditation; this was whatever the opposite of that was.

*Money, vodka, a gun.*

Once again they were overtaken, this time by a rattling pickup truck carrying poorly-secured iron girders. As he passed, the driver peered down at them from his high cab. It was a look without much curiosity, but for the women in the car every moment of contact was a potential breach, every glance an accusation. The truck driver pulled in in front of them and stepped on the gas. As the black exhaust fumes dissipated, they could see a slogan written on its receding rear end.

“*God is my navigator,*” the passenger read aloud.

“Lucky him,” the driver said drily. “We should go where he’s going.”

The passenger shrugged. “We know where we’re going well enough,” she said, tapping the road atlas in her lap.

*Money, vodka, a gun.*

*Money, vodka, a gun.*

“But we might need God’s help when we get there.”

## III

They might have been watching the building, but she had to take that chance.

It was a squat white Lego brick of a building, of the kind so common in Ez Raam: years ago, with much of the city reduced to wartime rubble and many of its best architects buried beneath it, the urban planners had picked out one good design that looked wide enough at the base relative to its height not to fall down until at least they were due to retire, and stamped out scores of them.

The rebuilt boulevards had been renamed after the war dead. This was Raga Siyanesh (Martyr) Street, commemorating some lad who had been killed by a missile here, or else who had lived here, and been drafted, and then died at the front; and then because of his youth, or his exceptional bravery, or some other thing that had made Raga’s martyrdom especially tragic, he had been awarded not only naming rights for the street, but also a small shrine. A plaque on the shrine doubtless told Raga’s story, but the woman standing in its shadow had never read it, and wasn’t going to now.

She was a strange sight, this woman. Clearly exhausted, she was leaning on the shrine for support in a way that would have horrified some people. But if anyone had objected, she would have given them a look that would have silenced them quickly. She was wearing a headscarf, trousers covered in dirt, and what looked like a man’s coat. She had been waiting there for the last quarter of an hour, eyeballing the building’s front entrance. A few minutes ago an old man and his wife had gone inside, their arms laden with bags of groceries; that was all.

She saw nothing amiss. But would she ever have done? She knew she had only seen glimpses of what her enemy could throw at her. The ones she had had to deal with so far, however brutal, had been enthusiastic amateurs rather than professionals. If real craftsmen were after her, she would be in serious trouble. For all she knew, they were here already, surrounding her, ready to pounce the moment she stepped into the light.

At this point it hardly mattered. She had to take the chance.

Nothing was standardised in Ez Raam, a city that was equal parts traffic jam and construction site, with numberless warring factions of building firms digging up each others’ foundations and poaching one another’s materials. Nevertheless, there were some motifs that were common. This road was a good example. It and the pavement were separated by a deep gutter, with trees planted in it, kept healthy by a steady stream of water that was pumped into the channel somewhere uphill. The trench was difficult to cross except where small metal grilles had been added as bridges. The woman stood on the nearest bridge to the building, gauging the speeds and distances of the oncoming cars.

The way to cross a busy road in Ez Raam was to step right into it, cars be damned. Cars would miss you. They’d swerve at the last moment. Hesitating, stepping backwards, leaping out of the way of one vehicle and into the path of another, *that* could kill you. Crossing the road required determination, nerve.

When the woman stepped into traffic, she walked with a pronounced limp.

Inside the building, the concierge’s booth was empty, as it was half the time; the other half, he was asleep at his desk. There was a security camera in one corner, but she knew that it was just for show, much like the lift, which hadn’t worked in years. She reached the stairwell unobserved.

Three floors to climb, her right ankle screaming at her. This, she thought, would be a good place to grab her. They could be waiting around any of these corners. There would be nowhere to run, even if she could.

She reached the top, paused for breath there. She listened, but could hear only a faint, constant ringing sound. That would be noise-induced ear damage: over the last few hours it had diminished, but not disappeared, and she wondered if it had fallen to the level it would remain at for the rest of her life. Not a disability, but a permanent souvenir of the worst thing that had ever happened to her.

A left turn into the main corridor. Her destination was the fourth door on the right. Standing in front of it, in the creamy flicker of a distant fluorescent light, she felt her whole body tense as she saw the damage.

Someone had been here before her. Someone who wanted in, and who had brought a power drill. She extended a finger to the door’s lock and touched the sharp metal rim of the hole that had been bored just above the keyway, demolishing the pins. A flat-headed screwdriver or pair of needle-nosed pliers had been used to rotate the barrel and open the door.

Well. She hadn’t expected anything else.

She wondered if whoever had done this was still inside. She supposed it was possible, in which case the sensible thing would be get out of there: to already be creeping backwards, down the corridor, out of the building, and hailing a cab to take her to safety.

Instead, she opened the door, and stepped inside.

Determination, nerve: it was just like crossing a road.

---


\noindent As soon as she was inside she knew the apartment was empty. Just in case there was someone watching from the road, she kept the lights off, relying on the sodium glow of streetlights through the curtains.

She wasn’t surprised to see that the place had been searched.

They’d gone through her drawers and cupboards, riffled through her clothes. Her laptop was gone, of course, along with the stacks of printouts on either side of it. On any other day this would have been catastrophic, but today was almost a consolation: reading all that stuff might slow them down, send their hunt in the wrong direction. It might buy her time.

She walked around silently, assessing the damage.

It hadn’t been their main objective, but while the intruders had been here they’d helped themselves to anything valuable that would fit into a pocket. There had been a brick of banknotes in her bedside cabinet: they’d found that, but not the main stash, which was better hidden. Most of her jewellery had gone too. None of that had been expensive, but a lot of it was of emotional value. She’d process that loss when she had time, but for now her immediate concern was the pile documents they’d pulled out of her desk drawers. She spent a few minutes poking through those: the bank statements, official letters, old electricity bills...

They’d taken her passport.

*Shit.*

Feeling suddenly weak, and terribly tired, she sat on her bed and shut her eyes. Forced herself to stay calm. Forced herself to think *clearly.*

No passport meant no escape: no quick getaway on the next flight to wherever would take her without a visa. This had only ever been a backup plan, but its removal made her feel like an acrobat who’d just launched into a tricky manoeuvre, only to see that the safety net had been whisked away while her back had been turned.

But nobody ever died merely from the removal of options. Right now the path ahead was clear, which was a comfort of a sort. She couldn’t run, which meant, for now, that she had to hide. Her apartment was no longer safe, but she wouldn’t last five minutes on the streets of gaudy Ez Raam without a change of clothes – and a shower. The coat she had worn smelled of someone she didn’t like, and she wanted desperately to wash that off along with the blood.

She nodded to herself, stood up – then froze, staring open-mouthed at the wall in front of her.

She had always assumed that as she grew older and more worldly, she would develop a better idea of what to hang on the walls of the rooms she inhabited. When she had first moved out of her father’s place and gone to uni, her dormitory had been decorated with posters of American movies. Later on, she had begun to see (or been told often enough that she ought to see) these as a sign of immaturity, and had graduated to art prints: Klimt, Vettriano, M F Hussain, a big one of Picasso’s *Portrait of Françoise*. Later still, she had embraced minimalism, thinking it classier (and knowing it to be cheaper). Walls were painted white and left unadorned – with one exception.

Along the long wall of her bedroom she had pinned the largest map of the country she could find. The map was big, but so was the nation of Ramestan, and even at this generous scale not every small settlement could be labelled. One place, of particular personal importance to her, had been absent. And so she had marked it herself: an arrow pointing to an otherwise empty grid square, with a label written in her own clear, neat handwriting.

*Ez Nezeshti.*

She stared at those words, stupefied, as icy realisation cracked across her skull. Was it possible? Surely not.

But she knew it was.

Not only possible, but certain.

She felt the world around her lurch, felt her stomach tighten in horror. A hand went to her mouth and she staggered to the bathroom, where her body folded to a kneeling posture. She retched drily into the toilet bowl.

*No, no, no...*

The nightmare of these last few days, the spiral of death and violence that had already destroyed so much, and so many: could it all have started here, in this apartment, with that simple, idiot gesture of drawing an arrow on a map?

Could it all have been, at bottom, her fault?

## I


Malaf had been arrested. A pair of plain-clothes Guards had yelled at her to stop walking and put her hands in the air. She’d already had her mobile in her hand, and had been able to play dumb for long enough to fire off that one text before they had handcuffed her and thrown her into the back of their van.

What followed was bureaucracy, photographs, fingerprinting, and a great deal of shoving around, so that it was only much later that she was marched into a windowless room in a police station with a table and two bolted-down chairs, and ordered to sit down.

The man who had taken over most of the shoving in the last few minutes sat down opposite her. He had a face one might have called ‘long-suffering’, and an expression suggesting that if he suffered any more at the hands of the woman in front of him, he’d make sure that she suffered with him.

The *Guards*. Why were the *Guards* interested in her?

The Guards were not the police; neither were they the army. They did not answer to the government. This at least had the advantage of giving the President some superficial deniability on the international stage, useful for whenever some bore at the UN made noises about human rights violations. Instead of being an official apparatus of the state, they were merely concerned citizens who were keen on religious and social order, who sometimes got carried away with themselves. They claimed to follow advice laid down by ‘the clergy’, although that was only ever a shorthand for a small number of powerful though never named imams. Technically they lacked even the power of arrest, although when looking down the barrels of their assault rifles, it was generally inadvisable to debate their legal status.

That was why she had been brought here – not to a Guard station, but to a regular cop shop, with facilities to hold prisoners overnight or else move them elsewhere for further processing. She had expected a handover of some kind. *We caught this woman snooping around. She’s your problem now. You deal with her.* There shouldn’t have been any need for further Guard involvement. And yet here they were.

A long moment stretched out as the man and woman eyeballed each other. The air was cool and dry, the light flat and white. It made the man’s skin look pimpled and craggy; Malaf didn’t suppose she looked much better.

Eventually the man said, flatly: “Name?”

“I gave it at the door,” Malaf said, tilting her head slightly. “Don’t they tell you these things?”

“Your name is Malaf Sagheedi.”

“And what is your name, Captain?”

So the woman knew Guard insignia, and wasn’t afraid to show it. The Captain absorbed this, but kept his face blank. “Occupation?”

“What have I been arrested for? I’ve done nothing wrong.”

The Captain attempted smiling at her. “Please. Make this easy for us both. You are here because I want you to answer my questions. I am now asking you what your occupation is.”

“I’m a translator.”

“What languages?”

“I’m flattered that you ask. English and French.”

“Translating what?”

“It depends. Mostly novels. A few academic texts. The diaspora community keeps me busy.”

“You do business with foreigners? The British? The *Americans?*”

Malaf rolled her eyes theatrically at the veilled accusation. “You do know what a translation *is*, don’t you?”

“They give you a lot of money, these foreigners?”

“Yes, I rob them blind. I consider it my patriotic duty. What am I doing here?”

“You were walking around alone in the middle of the night. Explain.”

Malaf shrugged. “I’d been visiting friends. I was walking home.”

“Where do you live, Miss Sagheedi?”

“If you know my name, you know my address.”

“It’s a long way from where you were arrested. And you were on foot. A little strange that you didn’t take a taxi, no?”

Malaf let her expression say it: *there’s no law against walking.* She folded her arms across her chest as though waiting for the Captain to say something that interested her.

When she’d arrived at the station the Guards had given her a black gown and told her to wear it, and she had thrown it back at them, insisting (correctly) that her headscarf-and-long-coat combo put her well within the law, and also (again, correctly) that the gown hadn’t been washed in weeks, and stank. Malaf didn’t go in for the riotous colours of her friends: she was dressed in neutral grey and brown, her nails unpainted, her make-up subtle. She’d pulled her headscarf slightly further forward than she would normally wear it, making certain that none of her hair was on show. Apart from that, she’d made no effort to impress him. If the lack of sleep bothered her, the glare she fixed him with gave no sign of it.

“You were walking down Kharo Tolhedi (Martyr) Avenue,” the Captain said, slowly, firmly. “At the corner of Isa Bikan (Martyr) Street, you paused in front of a residence. You looked in through the windows of the ground floor flat. You circled the building. Explain.”

“I have committed no crime.”

“You have if I say you have, Miss Sagheedi. Explain.”

Malaf calculated quickly. Her instinct was to deny everything, but this would have been a mistake. Right now, the Guards couldn’t do much to her. Well, they *could* – they were the Guards, they could do anything – but beyond the spite and caprice for which they were duly famous, they had no especial reason to. Malaf had done nothing illegal, and the Captain knew this. If she behaved, eventually the effort of detaining her would outweigh any potential benefits. He would get bored of her, and she would be released. To be caught telling a lie would undo that in an instant: it would give him a reason to lock her up that hadn’t been there before.

So, within reasonable limits, she would have to be honest.

“The house belongs to someone I know,” Malaf said, carefully.

“Her name?”

*So we know it’s a woman,* Malaf thought. *Interesting.*

“Lineh Parkiesh. I was looking through the windows to see if she was in.”

“Why not call her?”

“I was about to when your goons showed up.”

“What were you doing there so late at night?”

“I told you. I was visiting friends.”

“Their names?”

“Um, go to hell?” suggested Malaf. “They aren’t part of this story. I figured I could walk from theirs all the way home. I was an idiot: it was way too far, and about an hour in I’d clocked that. I was looking out for a cab but the roads were quiet. Then I realised I was near Lineh’s place, and figured I might drop in on her.”

“Did you call her first?”

“No. I thought I’d surprise her.”

“Pretty late in the evening to make a surprise visit.”

Malaf just shrugged.

The Captain persisted. “You and Lineh Parkiesh are friends?”

“Yes.”

“Details. When did you meet? Where?”

Malaf made an exasperated gesture. “Why do you care?”

“Because,” the Captain snapped, “what if I think your story stinks? You say you were peering through her windows late at night, preparatory to banging on her door and expecting to sleep on her couch? It sounds thin. Either you were best friends and had the kind of relationship where this is acceptable behaviour, or you were planning to break into her house and I put you away until the world ends. Which is it? Explain, now.”

“All right, all right,” Malaf said, raising her hands in surrender. “I’ve known Lineh for a couple of months now. She’s learning French. There’s a shisha bar called Café Kesh, and each week there’s a hangout for people to practise speaking. I go there sometimes to stop my accent getting rusty. I don’t know that she got much out of it: she was a complete beginner, and pretty much everything went over her head. She just sat there, smoking and not talking and looking miserable.”

“So you started talking with her?”

“So I started talking with her.” Malaf nodded. “She didn’t come every week. But we got on well.”

“What did you do at these meetings?”

“With Lineh?” She shrugged. “Mostly we played board games.”

“Board games?”

“Board games. It’s what people did before fun was invented. Café Kesh has a stack of them. We tried a new one each week, or rather each time she was there. And it was too slow for her to talk in French all the time, so we usually just did that for a few minutes then switched to Rami. We talked.”

“About?”

Malaf made an exasperated gesture. “I don’t know. Whatever. Girl stuff.”

By which Malaf meant hair, make-up, international politics, shoes, freedom of speech, history, modernist English poetry, petroleum economics, ways of using eyeshadow, ways of evading the Guards. How to configure a Tor relay, encrypt an email, pirate a movie, run in high heels.

“And when did you last see Ms Parkiesh?”

“I don’t remember exactly,” Malaf said. “I haven’t seen her since the last time she came to Café Kesh.”

It was almost audible. *Ding! Your first lie!*

The Captain studied her expression carefully. A long silence began.

When Malaf had first been brought here, pulled bodily out of the van and marched at gunpoint into the station, of course she had been scared. But as time had gone by, this fear had given way to bafflement.

Malaf had been arrested twice before in her life. The most recent time had been a few years ago: a Guard squad had picked her up over some vague issue with her coat being ‘too tight’. They’d held her for a couple of hours then let her off with a fine. She’d refused to pay and they hadn’t chased her up about it. Most probably they’d lost the paperwork. The time before that had been more serious. At uni she’d taken part in a student demonstration. She had spent the night in a jail cell, and had been young enough and stupid enough to think it terribly exciting.

So she had been here before – not *here*, in this building, but in buildings like it, with people like the Captain – and while not exactly an expert, she was at least familiar with how these things usually went. And everything that had happened tonight was striking her as odd.

She genuinely hadn’t been doing anything illegal outside Lineh’s house, and yet they had grabbed her off the street anyway. Why? There had to be a reason – a real reason, beyond the vague half-explanations about suspicious behaviour – and she couldn’t see what that reason could be. So fear had become puzzlement.

And what did she feel *now?*

Malaf was intensely aware of the danger she was in. Every second she was in this room, with this man, she ran the risk of saying something, or of doing something, or of being found out to have done something, that would put her in serious trouble. But despite all that, what she truly felt was excitement.

Every question the Captain asked – and also each question he could have asked, *should* have asked, but didn’t – told her something new. This was better than gold: it was *data*. Just by being questioned, she was learning.

Learning more about what had happened to Lineh.

Still the Captain’s silence went on. Malaf knew it was meant to unnerve her, to make her say more. And if that was the intention, it worked.

“Look,” she said with a weary sigh. “If you don’t believe me, why don’t you just call Lineh and check? Eh? Save us both some time. She’ll confirm everything I’ve told you.”

The stare continued. Malaf counted it in heartbeats.

“All right,” the Captain said, “I’ll do that.” Slowly, tiredly, he got to his feet. From a standing position he glared down at Malaf, inviting her, stonily, to hedge, bluster, backtrack. *If you’re bluffing,* his look said, *now’s your last chance to take it back.*

Malaf met his gaze squarely. *If you think I’m bluffing, call her. Go on. I dare you.*

And then, with a tiny shrug, the Captain turned, and walked out of the room.

And Malaf, who *had* been bluffing, thought: *Shit!*

---

\noindent A pair of uniforms came in and grabbed a shoulder each. Malaf let herself be transported down a flight of steps into a brightly-lit sub-basement. Everything smelled of disinfectant.

They put her in a holding cell that was long and narrow with a toilet at one end. A plank of wood running along one side acted as a seat or, if one were creative with one’s sleeping position, a bed. Malaf was tired enough to think any horizontal surface comfortable, and stretched her body out along it, kicking off shoes whose laces had been confiscated.

She lay there with her eyes shut, and although she may have slept, she couldn’t be sure. Of the images passing through her mind, it was hard to tell which were dreams, and which were just thoughts about the nightmare tonight was becoming.

There was no doubt about it: when Malaf had tried to peer through Lineh’s windows, Ms Parkiesh had already been on the Guards’ radar. There had been people watching the house. When Malaf had arrived in the middle of the night, they had seen her, and hadn’t known what to do. They’d panicked, and in their panic they had arrested her, thinking that if they ever needed to provide a reason for having done so, they would be able to come up with one retroactively.

All of which made sense, but only posed further questions, beyond the obvious one of how Malaf was going to get out of this dangerous mess. Questions like: why were the Guards watching Lineh’s house? And how much worse would her situation have been if the Guards had held back long enough for Malaf to move to the next step of her plan, which had been to climb over the wall into Lineh’s garden, and throw a rock through her kitchen window?

Questions like: were the Guards aware that Lineh Parkiesh had disappeared?

---

\noindent A thump at the door yanked her to full awareness. Once more she was marched along grey concrete corridors. She wasn’t taken to the original interview room. Indeed, she soon appreciated that that room had been a kind of *de luxe* interrogation suite, designed to make a good impression on people making their first visit to the station. This new place stank of sweat and urine. Turning in her seat, Malaf could see a brown stain streaking across the wall, only partly washed off. She wondered what kind of force would be required to spatter someone’s blood that way.

She was left alone for an unknowable length of time, which she passed with her eyes fixed on the grey wall in front of her, fingers resting lightly on the tabletop. Then the door swung open and the Captain entered. Now he was holding an official-looking folder, fat with A4 paper. This, she knew, was theatre: the idea of the Guard amassing so much information on anyone was to credit them with levels of competence and efficiency they could only dream of. But the fact that they wanted to frighten her was itself frightening.

The Captain sat down in the chair facing her, letting the folder slap onto the table’s hard melamine surface, and stared at her. Malaf met his gaze, and then, not wanting to get drawn into a macho staring contest, coolly leaned forward to try to read the time off his wristwatch. Before she could get a good look the Captain twitched his wrist irritably and opened the folder, revealing a photograph, black and white, face-on, of Malaf.

Malaf had a sudden feeling that things were about to get ugly.

“Lineh Parkiesh did not corroborate your story,” the Captain told her, smiling thinly. “Fortunately, there is plenty in here to talk about in the meantime.”

“Didn’t corroborate because she contradicted me,” Malaf asked, “or because you couldn’t reach her?”

“Reading through your file, we find many interesting things.” He tilted the file towards himself so that only he could see what was there. Perhaps he was just looking at blank paper and ad-libbing. Perhaps not. “Your name comes up in a lot of rumours – old, of course, but they don’t go away. Seen at a party drinking alcohol. And... suspected of having handled stolen or smuggled goods? My word.”

“For God’s sake, did you chimps even *call* Lineh?”

The Captain shut the folder. “We were not able to reach her. Which means that you were standing outside an empty house, looking through its windows. Combine that with the contents of this file... we’ve given people hell for worse.”

“I’d like to make a phone call.”

“You told me you were visiting friends. You will tell me their names.”

“Phone call.”

The Captain gave her a tired look. “You are confused about your location, Ms Sagheedi. You think you are in America. In a TV drama. You want to call your lawyer? *Please.*”

“I don’t know any lawyers,” Malaf said. “I want to call the Deputy Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture.”

The Captain hesitated as he tried to parse this. “Say that again?”

“I,” she said, making each word clear. “Would like. To make. A te-le-phone call. To the Deputy Minister. For Fisheries and Aquaculture.”

He frowned. “Why would you want to do that?”

“Because he’s my father,” she said.

## II

At last the woman in the passenger’s seat let herself relax: the Pasham Sixty had made it out of Ez Raam unmolested.

But then, of course it had. The odds of their car being stopped had always been minuscule; and of the space of possible futures in which they did get pulled over, the ones in which they were actually searched and their cargo discovered were a vanishingly small subset, inflated out of all proportion in the woman’s mind by a lifetime of television dramas and crime novels.

She looked across at the driver, a woman in her thirties named Irooj. It had been Irooj who’d agreed to carry the booze and the gun, and she’d done it without a second’s thought, as though it had been an elderly neighbour’s groceries. The passenger wondered, a little bitterly, if Irooj thought she’d gone soft.

Irooj was taking them down an eight-lane highway that struck out of Ez Raam and stretched endlessly, laser-straight, into the arid nothingness of the Ramestani west. In the early stages they had driven past palm trees, pomegranate plantations, patches of unnatural green maintained by hugely expensive water pipelines. The last of those had been some time ago. Now, the landscape on either side of the road was barren scrubland. Through the clear, dry air, they saw miles of flat grey earth, bounded in the extreme shimmering distance by white-tipped mountains.

They had shrugged off their black gowns as soon as they had cleared the city. They would be driving down this highway for many hours to come, and had made themselves comfortable, their headscarves loose around their shoulders. The road atlas, which would not be needed until the journey’s later stages, lay unopened on the passenger’s lap. Its front cover was a montage of photos, sun-bleached with age, showing what the publishers saw fit to present as the highlights of Ramestani life. In one corner, Ez Takhab’s Grand Mosque; in another, a spice shop in a bazaar; in another, a glass-walled skyscraper in Ez Raam’s commercial district; in another, grinning headscarved children; and stamped across this, in glossy pink, was the silhouette of Ramestan itself.

Like many of the countries of the Global South, Ramestan was north of the equator, but not by much; and, like a lot of its neighbours, the Mercator Projection had not been kind to it. It was bigger than it looked on a world map, and emptier. Its population was substantial, but Ez Raam, the nation’s hugely sprawling capital, hoovered up bodies and souls from hundreds of kilometres around. Vibrant, noisy, dirty, dangerous, ugly, beautiful: the beating heart of Ramestan was the only place to be.

Start in Ez Raam and draw a line due west. The line passes through a few biggish towns, separated by huge tracts of dry, flat emptiness. Follow that line until you feel the last traces of civilization are behind you; then, at the edge of the world, turn south, into the mountains. This was where the road atlas would come in handy. And it had to be *this* atlas, too, or one at least as old as it. Their destination didn’t appear on any maps printed after the war.

They were going to a place that no longer existed.

Irooj glanced at her watch. “Ooh! Wait! It’s time.”

“Time for what?”

“We’ve just hit ten AM. It’s time for the news. What’s your bet?”

The passenger glowered at Irooj. “This is childish.”

“It’s engagement with politics. I’m so engaged right now. See how engaged I am? Call it.”

“Uh-uh. Not playing.”

“What, you’re going to remind me that gambling is a sin? Call it.”

The passenger sighed tiredly. “If you’re going to insist... All right. He’s doing fine.” The passenger shrugged. “Full remission. His doctors are baffled. It’s a miracle. God be praised. He’s thinking of running his first half-marathon.”

“That’s the spirit,” Irooj said with a grin, and turned on the radio.

They caught the newsreader mid-sentence. As he spoke his voice was cracked, sombre; perhaps he had recently been crying, or wanted to appear that way. The situation, he was saying, was very grave...

For an instant, the women’s eyes widened. In unison, they thought: my God, had it happened? They’d been joking about the possibility, but deep down they’d never really believed it could happen. Their minds rebelled at the thought. But could it finally have happened? Had the old man really, finally...

No. False alarm.

Their beloved Supreme Leader was reported to be still unconscious, but stable. Surgery would likely begin very soon. The people of Ramestan were called upon to pray for his swift recovery.

Irooj and her passenger let out a breath – which, with Irooj, turned into a snort of self-mocking laughter. “Wow,” she said. “I didn’t realise how fond we both are of him.”

“His plight indeed moves us,” the passenger said, deadpan.

“Reckon he’ll pull through?”

“Why shouldn’t he? There are, what, three hundred people on Earth with better healthcare than him? He’ll live to be a hundred and ten.”

Irooj tutted, turned off the radio.

There was a long stretch of silence, which Irooj didn’t like. She drummed her fingers on the steering wheel, hummed to herself. Eventually, she asked: “What made you change your mind?”

The passenger pretended not to know what Irooj meant. “Hmm?”

“It was a while ago now and old age is making my memory hazy,” the woman said, smiling, “but I distinctly recall a lady fitting your description saying she wanted nothing to do with... what did you say? ‘You bunch of narcissistic crackpots and your madcap quest for glory?’”

“I don’t remember putting it exactly like *that.*”

“I admit I’m paraphrasing, but that was the essence of it.”

“Bang on, yes.”

“So one minute you think we’re crazy, and the next you can’t wait to join us. What changed?”

“I am a creature of whim,” the passenger said. “I am but a leaf on the wind. Look beneath this exquisitely controlled facade, and all you’ll find is a crazy lady rolling dice.”

“Liar,” Irooj replied. “You’re an ultra-rational, coldly calculating psychopath. It’s like you stepped out of a microeconomics textbook. Come on, spill it: why did you change your tune?”

The passenger chuckled, but it was an uncomfortable sound. She wondered how much she could safely tell Irooj.

“I needed time to think about things,” she said, quietly. Catching a concerned look from Irooj, she blustered on, wishing she hadn’t spoken. “I just wanted to get away from Ez Raam. For a few days, at least. That’s all.”

“On the run, eh?” Irooj joked.

When the passenger shut her eyes, she could still feel the hand pressing over her mouth, cutting off her scream. Could still taste another person’s blood.

“Yeah,” the passenger said, and turned to look out of the window. “Something like that.”



\vspace*{50px}

## III

The woman with the limp stood in the shower of her apartment and watched pink, watered-down blood run in rivulets down her calves and swirl around her ankles before draining into the plughole. She spat out a bit more of the taste of vomit from her mouth, and wondered if she’d ever feel truly clean again.

Turning off the water, she pulled aside the shower curtain and turned to face the mirror hung above the sink. She wondered what a detailed forensic analysis of her body would reveal. Had the shower cleaned the gunshot residue from her hands, or would traces remain for days and weeks? She assessed the damage. Heavy bruising on her arms and legs. Small cuts and abrasions on her legs and hands. A larger cut on her scalp that had bled heavily before clotting. Her ankle hurt like hell.

*You look like you’ve been in a car crash,* the last person she’d spoken to had said. He’d sold her petrol and let her use the store’s bathroom to scrub the worst off her face. She’d paid and, unable to think of anything she could say to ease his suspicions, had simply left without saying a word. Maybe he had taken note of her vehicle’s number plate, but that wouldn’t matter: it was stolen anyway.

She felt better after the shower. The grime and grit had caked into her every pore, and had cracked into plates when she moved, like a second skin of dirt armour. Before the shower she’d been a silhouette drawn in earth. Now that all that had been washed away, she appeared almost human, however much one valued that.

She dried off, and then, still naked, she went down on her knees and started dismantling the panel on the side of the bath. All this did was expose the bare underside of the bathtub. Next came a difficult operation: bending an arm around the back of the tub and withdrawing the bundle of cash she’d hidden there. At least they hadn’t found *that.* It was gratifying that her years of paranoia had finally paid off.

The banknotes were mixed and hard to count. Judging by weight, she estimated she had the purchasing power for a week or two at the kind of motel that would turn a blind eye to a fake name. It bought her a period of reasonably assured safety. It was time in which she could lie low, gather her thoughts, amass information, rally her forces and then—

And then *what?*

Shaking her head, she padded into the bedroom, tossed the cash onto the bed and got dressed. The feel of clean, ironed clothes on her skin was reassuring.

Back into the living room to the desk she worked at. On the desk was a landline telephone. The clock on its answering machine told her she’d already taken too long. In and out in fifteen minutes, she’d told herself – and that was dangerous enough. But if she didn’t do this one last thing, she would never live with herself.

She picked up the phone. Scrolled though its memory to find a number she had dialled many times before. She heard the ringing and prayed the man would pick up this time.

It went straight to his answering machine.

She swore under her breath as she listened to the recorded voice. *Hang up now?* No. She was committed already, and if there was even the smallest chance it might help him...

“Professor Khesri, it’s me. Please, you have to listen to me.” Even as she started speaking she could hear herself getting faster, the words rushing out of her. “The work you did, the geological surveys... You chased up the way they used your signature. You went to visit them, to ask why they faked it. Professor Khesri, you’ve put yourself in terrible danger. They came after me and they might come after you too.”

She knew she wasn’t making any sense, but she couldn’t slow herself down. Could hardly breathe.

“They came after me,” she said again. “I don’t know how many they are, but they’re strong and they won’t stop. Please, find somewhere to go. Leave tonight. Please.”

She slammed the phone down, hands shaking uncontrollably. She took a long, slow breath to calm herself. *Okay.*

There was a closet in the living room. She found a warm coat, a headscarf and a backpack. In the bedroom she shovelled the cash into the backpack, followed by a change of clothes.

Invisible in the unlit bedroom, the map of the country hung hugely behind her. She tried not to think of the words she had written there, but she felt them on her back like a sunburn.

*Ez Nezeshti.*

A place name. A shared secret. A whispered curse.

The memory played out in front of her in sickening slow-motion: her own hand tracing the letters from right to left in Rami script, finishing with a show-off flourish. And with that recollection, the other associated memories, each smeared with new interpretations. Elephants and chariots, soldiers and cannons. That voice: *tell me the worst thing you ever did...*

She squeezed her eyes shut against tears, opened them dry. There would be time to cry later. Now she had to move.

She picked up the backpack and swung it up onto one shoulder. She turned—

—and heard a noise.

The tiniest rustle of a boot treading on carpet.

The breath stopped in her throat, and the woman silently jerked her body deeper into the bedroom. She tried to tell herself she had been mistaken, but a moment later came another footstep, treading carefully, stealthily, further into her apartment.

She had been stupid. She had ignored the danger. She had come back to her ruined home, and had stayed there just one minute too long.

They had found her.

And now, this time, they would surely kill her.

# THREE


\vspace*{50px}

## I

Malaf stood blinking in the hard white light of morning, holding in her arms a clear plastic sack containing her mobile phone, handbag, belt, shoelaces, and everything else the Guards had confiscated. The door of the police station swung shut behind her. As was common practice, they’d marched her out of a side exit, the kind that could only be opened from the inside, and it closed with an impressive mechanical thump.

She stood motionless for a few moments, gathering her thoughts. All in all, that had gone better than expected.

The inside of her head was such a tumult of emotion, she was interested to see which one would eventually win the struggle for dominance. For a while it looked like relief was in the lead, but then, ah yes, here it came now, leaping heroically into first place: *shame*.

She’d brought her father into it. For all her tough talk and supposed street smarts, when it had come to the crunch she’d been just another rich girl using her family’s influence to get out of trouble. Pathetic.

She stalked off down the street, shoving the contents of the plastic bag into her pockets. She checked her phone: no missed calls or messages. That was good news: the last thing she wanted was for anyone else to be involved in this mess.

“Morning, comrade! Need a ride?”

Malaf stopped mid-stride. A keen observer might have detected a strange double-hesitation: first, uncertainty about whether she’d really heard him, and whether that really was his voice, after so much time had passed; second, the tiniest instant in which she wondered whether she could reasonably pretend not to have heard, and walk away before it was too late. When she at last realised there was no escape, her whole body seemed to sag slightly. She turned around to face the speaker.

“Hello, Qaseh,” she said, wearily.

Qaseh was leaning against a sign that said ‘GOVERNMENT BUILDING NO PHOTOGRAPHY’, legs crossed at the ankle, looking perfectly at ease. She hadn’t seen him in years, but nothing had changed. That same used car salesman confidence. That same lazy smile. Like Malaf he must have been up all night, but he showed no sign of being tired. When Qaseh was at work, sleep was optional.

“Malaf. It’s been a long time. You look good.”

“Qaseh. You persist.”

Qaseh straightened himself to a standing position with a smooth, lazy motion. “We should probably go, if we’re going. I’m double parked in front of a police station.”

“You rebel.”

“Always. Shall we?”

---

\noindent The traffic was so bad it might have been faster walking. Qaseh drove while Malaf stared out of the window. If their silence was a battle of wills, Malaf lost.

“All right,” she said. “How?”

“How did I track you down, or how did I do it while looking so dashing?” Qaseh flashed her his toothiest smile. “Your distress signal. That text you sent to Abeej.”

“I didn’t say where I was.”

“You didn’t have to. You should look into vVhisper.”

“vVhisper?”

“It’s a messenger app designed for anonymity,” Qaseh explained. “Really quite impressive. The government would probably ban it if they knew how good it was. Which is why I don’t go advertising it to *just anyone*. Only my dearest and nearest.”

“I’m thrilled,” Malaf said. “But you didn’t answer my question.”

“Well, I hate to tell you this, but you have bad friends, who have led you to make terrible life choices.”

“This I already knew.”

“One of these choices has been to install the popular messenger app Texxtor, which allows you to send messages to other people who are equally misguided in their messenger app decisions.”

“Texxtor’s secure,” Malaf said, though even as she said it she knew that she had to be wrong somehow; otherwise, Qaseh wouldn’t be here.

“Texxtor *is* secure,” Qaseh agreed, “with excellent encryption between devices. But last year, they updated the software and added a feature most people didn’t notice. When you send a message, it tags it with time and location metadata.”

Malaf winced. “God damn it...”

“Uh-huh. Now, according to Texxtor’s official press release this is *strictly elective*,” Qaseh went on, “but the option is hard to find, it’s turned on by default and only security nerds know it exists. It doesn’t really matter, since the messages are still sent on an encrypted channel, but...”

“You had Abeej’s phone.”

“I had Abeej’s phone,” Qaseh confirmed. “He says hi, by the way. Now, all of this means that if the *Enemy*” – Qaseh often referred to the government in this way – “had got hold of his phone, they could have used it to find you. You really should turn that location-tagging off. Unless,” he added, brightly, “they’ve *already* found you, and you need my help. In which case, you should have had it on all along. Which you did.” He grinned at her. “Good job!”

She ignored the wisecrack and looked out of the window. Malaf had always considered herself pretty tech-savvy, and was annoyed at having been so comprehensively outdone. A good-natured and rational person would have been impressed with Qaseh’s skills, and would have felt honoured that he had turned them in her direction in her time of need. Since Malaf was feeling neither good-natured nor rational, her only thought was: *dickhead.*

“Pulling the data off Abeej’s phone took me all of thirty seconds,” Qaseh said. “Once I knew where the message was sent from, there’s only one police station nearby. All I had to do was drive over, and rescue you.”

“You didn’t rescue me,” Malaf reminded him. “I rescued myself.”

“I was *very close* to rescuing you.”

“What were you planning to do?”

“Ah...” Qaseh said, hinting at a vast and convoluted scheme that only those with intellects as vast as his could even begin to comprehend.

“Talking of my lucky escape,” Malaf said, reaching for her mobile and feeling suddenly miserable again. “There is a deeply awkward conversation I need to have now. Give me a minute, okay?”

“*No problem, baby,*” Qaseh said in English, and reached for his own phone, so that he could text while driving. Malaf scrolled through her contacts list and selected the entry for ‘Dad: Office’. With a reluctance that was almost painful she pressed ‘Call’.

The line buzzed softly in her ear. It rang just enough times for her to wonder if maybe he was in a meeting, and that the horror could be postponed for an hour or two...

“Hello?”

Noises in the background, people talking. Oh, well.

“Dad. Hey.”

“Malaf! Good to hear from you. It’s been a while. How are you doing?”

Malaf opened one of her screwed-shut eyes. She dared to hope. “I’m... I’m good, thanks. Are... are you good?”

“All fine here,” her father said, cheerfully. “Wrestling the usual gang of incompetents. Nobody seems to know what a deadline means, as ever. What’s on your mind?”

There was no trace of irony in his voice. Had it been anyone else, she might have suspected him of stringing her on, laying some kind of trap for her. But for a politician, Qoshoor Sagheedi was a desperately poor liar.

The realisation left her speechless. He didn’t know she’d been arrested. The Guards had heard his name and spooked. When they knew they had a Deputy Minister’s daughter in their cell, they’d chucked her out like a live grenade. Those beautiful fascist bastards: *they hadn’t even called him!*

“Oh. Um.” She floundered. “I was just wondering if you’ve received any packages for me.”

This alluded to her practice of occasionally getting things delivered to his office when she knew she was going to be out. Her father hated it when she did this, but put up with it because she gave him so few other opportunities to see her.

“Another? No, I don’t think so. I’ll check when I have time.”

“Great. Thanks. Well, I’d better go—”

Her father got in before her: “Malaf, just while I’ve got you... I wonder if you’ve had a chance to think about the party? It’s just around the corner and I need to know numbers.”

Malaf flushed with sudden panic. This was an issue she’d been trying not to deal with for almost a month now. If she hadn’t called, she might have got away with it, but now...

She cleared her throat. “Yeah, listen, I’d really like to come. But I’ve got a big translation project coming up – really urgent. It might arrive any day now. And I don’t know how long it’s going to take me.”

“I appreciate that,” her father said, almost certainly knowing it was a lie, “but it really would mean a lot to me if you could find time. Please think about it.”

“Yeah. Okay. I will.”

She ended the call and sat there a while, tapping her phone against her teeth, thinking.

“Your daddy didn’t sound too upset,” commented Qaseh, who’d heard every word.

Malaf shot him an irritated look, then shrugged. “He doesn’t know. I said his name in the station and they let me go. They didn’t call him.”

“Wow. You played the Dad card.”

“Yeah, I’m not proud of it. I had no choice. Things were getting serious.”

“Things sounded serious. Especially the part about the party.”

Malaf glared at him. “Is something being none of your business just a totally alien concept to you, or what? Dad’s celebrating twenty years in the ministry. He’s booked the Grand Astihari for it.”

“Ooh. Classy. He’s gone up in the world.”

“Apparently so. It’ll be hideous. Various mid-level political nobodies eating canapés and pretending not to despise one other.”

“It sounds as much fun as pancreatitis.”

“He wants me to be there.”

“Why?”

“God only knows. Showing his peers he has a virtuous family life.”

“*Your* presence signals *virtue?*”

“I know. It’s hilarious.”

“That said...” Qaseh shrugged. “If he wants you there, you should probably go.”

“I know I should,” she sighed.

“It could be useful.”

Malaf rolled her eyes. This kind of disconnect was common in conversations with Qaseh. What she had said had amounted to, “Familial obligation is driving me into a social situation which I would rather chew off my own arms than attend,” whereas what Qaseh had heard was, “I am being presented with a golden opportunity to mix with the ruling elite, gather actionable intelligence, and report back to you, O Handsome One.”

Qaseh brought the car up a slip road and onto an elevated highway. He immediately swerved to change lanes, causing drivers behind him to honk their horns furiously. He honked back, for form’s sake, then grinned at Malaf. “So: which particular crime or series of crimes did they try to nail you for? Littering? Jaywalking?”

“Breaking and entering.”

“You *are* joking, right?”

“I don’t know. Am I?” She raised an eyebrow at him. At last she’d impressed him. She felt oddly pleased.

“You can’t dangle that in front of me and say nothing, Malaf. What happened?”

Malaf shook her head. “Look, I’m really tired. I’ll talk about it at home, all right?” She looked out of the window, staring out at the ugly squat buildings below. And frowned. “Which... we appear to be driving in the exact opposite direction of.”

Qaseh smiled.

“Am I being kidnapped now?”

Qaseh laughed. “Nah, I thought I’d take you back to my place. Abeej is there. You spooked him pretty badly with that text. He wants to know you’re okay.”

“Ah. Yes.”

“And the others, too.”

Malaf continued to look out of the window for a moment, with that word bouncing softly around inside her brain, until, suddenly, it detonated. “Others?” she croaked.

“Sure. All of them.”

“*All* of them?”

“The whole crew. When Abeej got that text he sent out a distress signal. The beacons were lit. We rushed to your aid. It was beautiful.”

“How very industrious of you,” said Malaf. The sinking feeling she’d briefly had when talking to her father was as nothing to the plunge into the Marianas Trench her stomach was now enacting. She’d walked out of one trap and right into another.

Maybe, she wondered, if she asked politely, the Guards might put her back in jail...

Qaseh went on: “I just sent a message telling them you’re safe. They’re in the garden now getting breakfast ready. They can’t wait to see you again.”

“Great.” A whole bunch of people she wanted never to see again, all concentrated in the same place, and she was heading straight for it. There was nothing she could do to escape, short of throwing herself out of the moving vehicle, over the side of the elevated highway, and into space. While she weighed the pros and cons of this, a thought struck her.

“Wait. You have a garden?”

“There is a sense in which I do.”

---

\noindent Green spaces were hard to come by in Ez Raam. Most of the city’s public parks had been wrecked in the war. Over the following years, as the price of land skyrocketed, a cash-strapped municipality had had little incentive to look after the few that remained, since a desiccated wasteland was so much easier than well-watered flowerbeds to sell off and turn into high-rises.

And so, in order to satisfy the basic human need to lie on grass in the sun, Ez Raamers had invaded the city’s *other* green spaces: traffic islands, roundabouts, and the central reservations of highways.

Many of the busiest roads in the city were divided by enormous processions of Ramestani flags. These flags, and the narrow strips of garden they were planted in, were the only pieces of plant life the municipality seemed interested in maintaining. Technically these were government property and therefore completely off-limits to civilians, but in a town like Ez Raam there was no better spur to creativity than a poorly enforced law, or an easily climbable fence.

Qaseh’s ‘garden’ could be reached by sprinting across three lanes of fast-moving traffic, then scrabbling up a short, steep hill. The gravel’s tendency to slip under one’s feet made this extremely dangerous, but assuming one survived, it was then a simple matter to hop over the railing and land on green grass.

Malaf reached the top exhausted, and spent a moment standing bent over, hands on knees, glaring at Qaseh. He grinned at her, and led the way along the strip.

Traffic roared by very close on either side, making the garden anything but tranquil, but Malaf soon saw that it was a popular picnic spot. The thick bases of flagpoles were planted at regular intervals down the centre of the strip, and each of the spaces between them had been claimed by a different knot of people. Most, Malaf guessed, were students from the nearby Technical University. Some were playing board games, or reading books; a few were cooking food on tiny camping stoves. They laughed, talked, flirted. They were young in a way that made her feel old.

They walked on in silence for a few minutes, Qaseh a few steps ahead, Malaf a sulky distance behind. She saw them before they saw her: all four of them, sitting on a blanket, surrounded by paper plates piled high with bread, cheese, fruit. A wholesome scene, like something out of an advert. Like a family portrait.

Irooj was the first to notice. From a cross-legged position she sprang awkwardly to her feet, wiping crumbs off her clothes as she rushed towards her. She enfolded Malaf in a whole-body hug. And maybe it was just the tiredness addling her brain, but to her surprise, and in spite of everything, Malaf found herself hugging back.

“You okay?” Irooj asked in a whisper, between them.

Malaf nodded into her shoulder.

“Good.” That established, Irooj pulled back, repositioning the headscarf that had fallen loosely around her shoulders. She inspected Malaf’s face carefully. “Oh, but how the years have been cruel to you...”

Malaf smiled. “Bitch.”

“Come on,” Irooj said with a laugh. “Have some breakfast.”

The men had stood up by now. They lacked Irooj’s confidence on how to proceed, and hid behind an awkward formality: stiff handshakes, perfunctory air-kisses. Tusham wrapped her hand in both his huge paws, then went back to stand by Irooj. “Good to see you,” he said.

“You too,” Malaf said. She studied their body language, spotted the ring on Irooj’s finger, and registered, with surprise, that she and Tusham were a couple now.

“Glad you’re back,” Boraz told her.

“Well, they’ve not yet built a jail that can hold me.”

“And we’d have helped you escape,” Boraz said. “Hell, we were even thinking of putting Operation Uprising into—”

This statement was cut short by a quick nixing motion from Qaseh, as if this was not the time to discuss it. Boraz shut up. Malaf was too tired to be curious.

“Malaf,” Abeej said. “You had us all worried.”

Abeej looked exhausted. Malaf could hardly imagine the torment she’d put him through with that text. But beneath the tiredness, she saw him glowing with pride: of all the people she knew, *he* had been the one she had asked for help. She didn’t have the heart to tell him that his had simply been the first name on her contacts list.

“How have you been?” Tusham asked her. “I can’t believe I’m seeing you here. It’s been... how long?”

“At least ten years,” Irooj said.

“Ten years. Wow.”

“Yes, yes, we all have tremendously interesting life stories to tell,” Qaseh said. “But the most interesting one is, Malaf: why did the Guard arrest you?”

It wasn’t something Malaf wanted to talk about, and she had spent the walk over here trying to devise a socially acceptable reason for simply saying hello, thanking them for their concern, saying that they really ought to catch up soon, and then continuing to ignore them for the rest of her life. But when she saw the food, and became instantly, viscerally aware of how long ago she’d last eaten, she found in her heart and stomach a reason to compromise.

“Well...”

---



\noindent “So,” Qaseh asked, “which parts of that were true?”

Malaf ticked them off on her fingers. “I *do* know Lineh. I *was* visiting friends nearby. And Lineh’s place *was* on the way home.”

“But you didn’t *just happen* to find yourself at her doorstep, did you?”

“No. I went there to check up on her.” Malaf drained the last of her juice from a paper cup and tossed it into the bag they were using as a bin. She spoke slowly, choosing each word carefully. “I haven’t seen her in a while, and I want to know if she’s all right.”

“Any reason to think she wouldn’t be?” Irooj asked. She offered her another piece of flatbread, but Malaf shook her head.

“I haven’t heard from her in a while,” Malaf explained. “No texts, no messages.”

“Is that unusual? How close are you two?”

“Not so close,” Malaf told her. “We got on well enough in the French sessions. Met up a few times outside those. Coffee, that sort of thing. We talked a lot online.”

Irooj shrugged. “Maybe she just wanted some time to herself.”

“That’s what I thought, at first,” Malaf agreed. “But she’s usually pretty active online. All the major messenger apps, Facebook, whatever. Nothing on any of them for over a week now. It’s unusual.”

“I hate to break it to you,” Boraz said, “but it sounds like she’s blocked you.”

“Maybe,” Malaf conceded.

“Have you given her any reason to?” Qaseh asked. “Been particularly obnoxious lately?”

Malaf held up her open hands. *Maybe.*

“So she doesn’t text you for a few days,” Irooj said, frowning, “and so you try breaking into her house? This is the course of action that you, a sane person, decide to follow?”

“Well, the thing is, I’ve been getting into photography,” Malaf explained. “I finally got myself a good quality DSLR, with a proper zoom lens. Lineh is interested in photography too, and asked to borrow it. I said sure, as long as I could have it back for next weekend, when I’m going out taking pictures with a friend of mine—”

“A *boy*friend?” Irooj asked, leaning closer.

Malaf ignored it. “I sent Lineh a message asking for it back and didn’t get any reply.”

“Okay,” Irooj said, smiling. “It’s one thing if this Lineh woman wants some space and doesn’t reply to a text message, but ruining my friend’s romantic photography expedition with her potential future husband is *crossing a line.*”

Malaf nodded. “So when I found myself in her neighbourhood, I went to see if she was home. I was arrested before I could properly check. But my feeling is that the house was empty.”

“She’s probably on holiday,” Boraz suggested.

“Or away for work?” Abeej asked. “What does she do?”

“Some office job in a construction company,” Malaf said. “I don’t know the details. But it’s shuffling paper around. Not the sort of thing they send you overseas for. She didn’t mention any trip.”

“Maybe she just didn’t tell you,” Abeej said, ever the voice of reason. “Or didn’t want you to know. People don’t tell each other everything. Sometimes people lie.”

Malaf couldn’t deny this. People lied all the time. For example, Malaf had lied just now about lending Lineh her camera.

“I don’t understand where the Guards come into this,” Qaseh said, frowning. “They caught you breaking into her house?”

“No. They caught me looking at it.” Malaf frowned. “Nothing about last night makes sense. Why did they care? What did I do to upset them? And why were they watching her house in the first place? When they took me in they clearly knew who she was.”

“If you’re saying she’s disappeared,” Irooj said, “could they also be investigating her disappearance?”

“That would make sense,” Malaf agreed. “But why didn’t they say so when they were interviewing me?”

“Maybe they would have done,” Qaseh suggested, “but they didn’t get round to it. They had to let you go pretty quickly when you told them who your dad is.”

The look Malaf gave him would have killed a lesser man at thirty paces. Qaseh simply shrugged. Everyone else pretended not to have heard him. Tusham, covering the momentary silence, said, “At least you did get out. We didn’t have to bake a cake with a saw in it.”

“Or deploy... *‘Operation Uprising’*?” Malaf asked, an eyebrow raised.

Everyone looked around awkwardly.

“It’s an insurance policy,” Qaseh explained, very slowly. “In case one of us gets arrested by the Enemy and might be in real danger.”

“I feel suddenly relieved that you didn’t have time to use it.”

Qaseh nodded. “It’s a weapon of last resort. One of our little side-projects.”

This posed the question of what their *main* projects were, but Malaf decided she didn’t want to know. “Go on. What is it?”

“Qaseh makes it sound like a bigger deal than it is,” Irooj said. Abeej mumbled something about this being standard. “It’s based on some ideas activists have had in other countries. When someone disappears, it can be hard to get the message out to enough people, quickly enough, to put any kind of pressure on the authorities. So if you’re what we might call a high-risk individual, you’d want to have something in place in advance.”

Malaf later learned that although Irooj was employed by her company as a web developer, in practice her job was what in other countries would be called a social media coordinator. All social media platforms were banned and blocked within Ramestan, but the filters were so childishly easy to bypass that almost every corporation and individual in the country – including the Supreme Leader himself – had Facebook and Twitter accounts. So Irooj knew about getting noticed online. But Malaf had never heard of search engine optimisation used to get people out of jail before.

“I dread to ask,” Malaf said, “but what does this involve?”

“Without giving too much of our beautiful plan away,” Irooj explained, “one small part of it is registering domain names in case we need to make a campaign website. We’ve bagged *freeirooj*, *freeqaseh*, one for each of us. We even did one for you, *liberatemalaf*, since you’re part of the crew – you’re welcome, by the way.”

Malaf wasn’t sure which appalled her more: the existence of this website, or the fact that they still thought of her as one of them. “Not very catchy,” she said. “Why do you all get ‘free’ and I get stuck with ‘liberate’? What happened to freemalaf?”

“It was taken.”

“Oh, come *on*...”

Irooj threw up her hands in helplessness. “What can I say? Malaf’s a common name. Remember Malaf Aleeda? Feminist blogger, arrested five years ago? There was a big campaign to get her released.”

“That was what gave us the idea,” Abeej put in.

“Fair enough, I suppose,” Malaf said. “Did it work?”

“No,” Tusham said. “She hanged.”

There was another brief, uncomfortable silence, in which Malaf couldn’t help thinking that, in that case, it was a bit selfish of them to hang on to the domain name.

“So,” Qaseh said, clapping his hands cheerfully. “What are you going to do about your missing friend?”

Malaf looked at him warily. This was dangerous territory.

“Today’s Sunday,” she said. “I’ll go to Café Kesh – after I’ve got some sleep – and see if she shows up for tonight’s French session.”

“And if not?”

“Ask some questions, see if anyone knows where she’s gone. Do a little digging.”

She might have got away with it if she hadn’t added those last few words. In response, Qaseh sucked air through his teeth, like a plumber assessing a tangle of leaky pipes. “I wish we could help,” he said, “but we’ve got a lot going on now.”

“I didn’t ask for your help.”

“We’ve received—” He cut himself short, and looked around to check for eavesdroppers, quite redundantly since the traffic was so loud. “We’ve received some intelligence. Leaked documents. If they’re genuine—”

“I don’t care.”

“You might if you knew the name of the place they mention.”

“*I really won’t*,” she said, a little more forcefully than she’d intended. When she saw the others’ expressions she sighed. “Look,” she said, eyes closed. “I’m really flattered that you all came to my help like this. It was more than I expected when I sent Abeej that text, and I’ve not been a good enough friend to you to deserve it. I’m grateful, really. But despite that...”

Her plan had been to stare them down with her steely gaze. In execution, she found that she couldn’t meet their eyes.

“You’ve clearly – still – got something going on here that’s very exciting, very noble, and I’m glad you’re still at it. But it’s not for me anymore. I don’t have the...” *Will? Energy? Moral certitude? Reckless disregard for safety?*

“So that’s it,” she finished, lamely. “Please. You do your thing. I’ll do mine.”

After a pause, Qaseh shrugged. “As you wish,” he said.

And that was the end of it.

## II


The Ramestani car industry was a thing of which its citizens were intensely proud, not so much for its achievements as for its persistence. In the face of US sanctions that choked the import of steel and aluminium, *and* an inflation rate of over twenty percent, *and* the staggering rate of attrition of graduates to other countries, *and* the ubiquitous corruption and bribery that doubled the price of every vehicle leaving the factory – in spite of all these things, Ramestani companies had successfully produced some solid cars. They were reliable, popular, hard-wearing. Many could even, in a kitschy sense, be considered design classics.

The Pasham Sixty was not among them.

Although particularly famous for its uncomfortable seating, this flaw was merely the most obvious entry in a list that covered almost every aspect of the vehicle’s design. Its low fuel efficiency hardly mattered in a country where oil was so cheap, but its exhaust fumes were terrifyingly noxious. Multiplying by the numbers on the road, it was estimated that up to ten percent of Ez Raam’s notorious air pollution came from this model alone. Sixties were badly underpowered: they struggled to reach cruising speeds and, when they finally got there, they were inclined to rattle all over. An old joke among automotive engineers was that the reason cruise control had never been fitted was that driving at a constant speed for any length of time would set up standing waves in the chassis, causing the car to shake itself apart.

A tired wordlessness had fallen over the occupants of the Sixty driving west along desert roads away from Ez Raam. Because Irooj found long silences uncomfortable to drive in, and in part to cover the rattling, she said, “So: what was the biggest shock for you?”

Her passenger, who had spent the last few minutes staring out at the empty grey scrubland, looked over. “What do you mean?” she asked.

“You hadn’t seen us in years. What surprised you most?”

Malaf thought about this.

“I’d never have guessed you’d marry Tusham.”

Irooj laughed. “Funny, I get that a lot. Did you think we’re so different?”

“A classy lady like you? I didn’t think he was your type. Too... *punk rock,*” Malaf said, using the English phrase. The word had come to her because he’d been in a band, had spiked his hair up with gel, worn heavy-metal T-shirts; but the word had been her second choice, the first being *Neanderthal.* That wasn’t to suggest he’d been particularly unintelligent – none of them had been the sharpest or brightest in their classes. But she couldn’t get out of her head the great hulking mass of him, that arm-swinging gorilla gait.

Irooj shrugged. “He could be romantic when he wanted to be.”

“Who asked who out?”

“He asked me. It was all very deftly executed, actually. I had literally no idea. A bunch of us went on holiday to Istanbul. He and I went off from the others and went up Galata tower. We were looking out over the city, and he gave me this little speech about an inventor hundreds of years ago, who’d apparently jumped out of the tower with homemade wings, trying to fly. He said this was his own leap into the unknown, and proposed to me there and then, with a ring.”

“Wow. And you...?”

“Turned him down flat,” Irooj laughed. “Come on. Prior to that instant I hadn’t devoted one second’s thought with one brain cell to him in that way. So the rest of the holiday was pretty awkward. But it changed how we saw each other, and over the next year or so... well, I got used to the idea. And, eventually, with some prompting from me, he asked again.”

“That’s sweet.”

“Yeah.” Irooj was smiling as she recounted it. Then her smile broadened further, became mischievous. “Now, if we’re in the business of ranking likely versus unlikely pairings among the crew...”

“I’m not sure I like where this is going, but okay.”

“Way back then, when we were students, I do seem to recall kind of suspectiiiiing...”

“Yes?”

“...that you and Qaseh...”

“No,” Malaf said.

“...might have had...”

“Nope nope nope.”

“Okay, fine, but can you blame us for thinking it?”

“*Us?*” Malaf asked, faintly alarmed. “Was this something a lot of people thought?”

“You and Qaseh did seem to have a lot in common. Saw eye to eye on a lot of things. The tech stuff. Politics. I remember you swapping books, that Baku bloke.”

“Bakunin,” Malaf said, remembering it with a faint smile, “and Kropotkin. Russian anarchists. I was young and foolish.”

“Remember those debates in the car you used to have? Bored us all out of our minds, but you’d just talk and talk. Naturally, we all assumed there was something going on there. One could be forgiven for thinking it.”

“I forgive you nothing, Irooj. It’s obscene.”

Irooj grinned, but teased her no further. “It was strange, in those days. What we used to do. Can you believe it?”

Malaf shook her head. “No,” she said. “I can’t.”

---

\noindent The short version was this: when they had been students, Qaseh had asked Malaf if she would like to come with him, to help a gang of foreign criminals, whom he had never met, smuggle over the border some illegal goods, for money; and Malaf had said yes.

The conversation had begun in the university library, where Malaf was studying for a degree that would ultimately be far less useful to her future career than the fact she already spoke English and French fluently and had a decent grasp of how to file a tax return. Malaf, who was capable of enormous feats of concentration when it came to anything but coursework, had spent the last ninety minutes trying to work out if the shapes in a game of Tetris could be made to fit neatly into a rectangle. There were seven different Tetris blocks, and each was an arrangement of four squares. Seven sets of four squares meant twenty-eight squares to find space for. There were three rectangles with areas of twenty-eight squares. Their dimensions were: 1x28; 2x14; and 4x7. The first of these, a strip of twenty-eight squares in a line, she could eliminate immediately, since all but one of the Tetris shapes were two squares thick. The idea of fitting all seven shapes into a 2x14 grid couldn’t be ruled out so easily, but that looked too constrained to be likely. No, if the blocks fitted at all, it would probably be into a grid of four squares by seven. So she’d filled page after page of her notebook with rectangles of this size, and had been obsessively colouring them in with her highlighters, trying to find a configuration of all seven shapes that fitted exactly. No matter how often she tried, she would end up with one square poking out of the side. She was beginning to suspect that it might be impossible, and that there was some profound mathematical reason why, but she hadn’t found it yet and refused to look online for an answer. Meanwhile, her five thousand word essay, due in two days, remained slightly under two hundred words long.

“You know,” Qaseh had said, coming up behind her, “you can play that game on computers now.”

Conventional wisdom said that with the programmer types, the smarter you were, the more socially awkward and worst dressed, and Qaseh was very, very smart. But, rejecting convention in this as in so many other things, Qaseh was supremely comfortable in his own skin. His wardrobe was better stocked than any other student Malaf had met: she wasn’t convinced he even owned a T-shirt. He swung into every room with breezy confidence, flashing his hustler’s smile. He knew everyone’s name, was everybody’s best friend. It made him superbly likeable, and therefore insufferable.

“Good morning, comrade,” Malaf said, leaning back and rubbing her eyes. “What’s new?”

“Well...”

They’d taken the conversation downstairs, to a crowded café where they were less likely to be overheard.

“Have you been getting headaches lately?” she’d asked, genuinely curious, when he’d finished. “Heard voices, hallucinated, anything like that?”

“You think I’ve gone mad.”

“It would be hard to tell, given *your* baseline, but it would explain a lot.”

“Okay, I admit it’s a bit crazy,” he conceded.

“Completely.”

“What would you change to make it sane?”

And so Malaf had made herself an accomplice – merely as a hypothetical exercise, of course. The way she saw it, there had to be six of them: two to load the goods, two to hand over the money, and two more to sit in the vehicle the whole time, doing nothing.

“Why?”

“Why indeed?” Malaf asked, an eyebrow raised. “Bringing along two extra bodies would make no sense. We’d have two more people in on the secret, and splitting six ways instead of four would bring our share of the loot down by a third. We’d have no reason at all to bring them.”

“Unless?”

“Unless they’re armed.”

“But they won’t be.”

“Ah, but the people we’re buying from will think they must be. Otherwise, what would they be there for?” She leaned forwards, lowered her voice even further. “The real difficulty will be fencing the cargo at our end.”

“I know some people,” Qaseh said airily.

From someone else, that would have sounded like bluster. But Qaseh – and, to an extent, Malaf too – were the kind of people who *did* know people. They weren’t like their fellow students: they mixed in different circles, went to the *other* parties, lived life at a slight angle to the rest of society. If anyone could find a way to move the goods, Qaseh could.

Irooj was an obvious early recruit: they both knew her well, trusted her. She became involved early enough to be a major influence on how their plan evolved. She was the one who suggested bringing Boraz in: they needed someone practical, good with cars. Abeej and Tusham had been Qaseh’s idea. So had the place for the exchange.

“You’re sure it was *you* who picked this site?” Malaf asked, sitting with him on a bench outside the campus mosque, eating an ice cream.

“Sure. Who else?”

“I want to be sure you chose it, not that they chose it and you said yes.”

“Afraid of walking into a trap?” Qaseh asked. Malaf looked at him as if this ought to have been obvious, even to him. Qaseh flapped a hand dismissively. “Relax, Malaf. I did my homework. I picked the spot out of an old map. Read up about it in the library here. It’s perfect: a town near the border, isolated. Probably quite interesting, too. Are you going to bring your good binoculars?”

“What do you mean, an ‘old’ map?”

“You can’t find it on postwar ones.”

“Why not?”

“Because everyone who used to live there is dead now.”

Some of the problems they faced were simple. How could they move the cargo in bulk? Well, Tusham could borrow his bandmate’s van for those days, and Abeej had a car of his own. Other problems were harder, and some, technically, insurmountable. For example, how could they be certain that this whole thing wasn’t some elaborate sting operation? It wasn’t unknown for the Guards to entrap people this way. It was often politically motivated: one faction’s attempt to gain leverage over another. Malaf’s father wasn’t yet a Deputy Minister, but eyes were surely on him by now, and that made Malaf attractive as a potential legal hostage.

There was no way of knowing for sure. But once suggested, and taken seriously, their scheme had a kind of momentum to it, an inexorability. It became its own justification. Talking about it had made it real.

And so later that week, before dawn, the six of them drove out in the direction of Qaseh’s mysterious border town.

It was the longest road trip most of them had ever been on, a drive of many long hours talking politics and listening to Qaseh’s terrible music. It would have been impossible to come back the same day, so they had brought tents, food, games. It was an adventure.

They arrived at the small town in the late afternoon. There was a nightmarish beauty to the place. They camped out among the ruined buildings like the last survivors of a global apocalypse, and waited.

The next morning, the smugglers arrived.

Boraz, who had gone to watch from higher ground, managed to give them a few minutes’ warning over the two-way radio. It was a single red pickup truck, driving straight for them. The students got into position just as they had planned.

The pickup truck swung around and came to a stop near where they had camped. Two men got out. *Only two,* Malaf thought, strangely embarrassed. *We must look like kids on a school trip to them.*

They had, among themselves, rehearsed various scenarios. Malaf had devised a complex triangular exchange pattern, with money and goods set down and picked up and examined and moved around in ways that ensured maximum security for all participants in a zero-trust situation. Her findings, properly rephrased in the language of game theory, were probably publishable in a quality journal. On top of this, they had wargamed a huge number of ways the smugglers might attempt to screw them over. But in the end, the strangers were so blasé about things, the whole effort sort of deflated.

“Who is Big Q?” one said.

Qaseh cleared his throat. “I am,” he said. Malaf and the others stared at him. It was the first time they had heard this online moniker. It sounded ridiculous.

“Okay.” This appeared to be the extent of the smuggler’s spoken Rami. Fortunately, the prices had been arranged previously online. Without further ceremony, the two men dumped four wooden crates onto the ground, collected the cash from Qaseh’s trembling hands, and drove off.

“Well,” Malaf said. “That part was easy.”

The hard part was to find buyers for two large crates of inexpensive Chinese radios, and two of Russian cigarettes. This Qaseh was able to do shortly after their return to Ez Raam. The crew finally relaxed, and counted their winnings. After subtracting their outlay and dividing by six, these were comically slight. But that hardly mattered. This had been a proof of concept. Now that the channel had been opened, they were keen to see what else could be done.

They made six runs in total. Each time they went into the desert they came back with a bigger and more lucrative haul. Different products each time: perfume, counterfeit jeans, canned meat... The returns went from paltry to quite respectable, and the trips themselves began to become something they would look forward to. It was fun.

But on the sixth trip, something changed.

When they arrived in their pickup truck, the smugglers – with whom the students had become quite chummy by now, though their conversation was conducted mainly via monosyllables and pointing – looked unusually serious. They invited Qaseh to come talk to them, alone, by their truck.

Malaf watched with growing unease as they showed him their cargo. She watched Qaseh’s expression change from puzzlement to surprise to anger. There was a terse discussion, too distant for all but the loudest parts to be heard. Finally Qaseh stalked back, leaving the smugglers standing by their pickup truck, smoking cigarettes and idly kicking the loose dirt on the road.

“What happened?” Tusham asked.

“Idiots!” Qaseh snapped. “Goddamned bastard whoring... They changed the shipment.”

“What?” Boraz asked. “They can’t do that.”

“Well, they have. It’s not what they agreed to sell.”

“So what do they have?” Malaf asked.

Qaseh had already started walking back to the pickup. “Come see,” he said to her over his shoulder.

Malaf followed him to where the two smugglers were standing. They nodded to her briefly in greeting, then stepped aside to let her look. Her eyes widened.

“Ah,” she said, softly. “Yes. I see our dilemma.”

The crates were filled with clear plastic bags. Each bag was densely packed with moss-green, fuzzy-looking, dried flower buds. Malaf was no expert, but she was worldly enough to recognise cannabis when she saw it. Deep in thought, she went back to tell the others.

They reacted with alarm. Their previous missions, though unquestionably illegal, had had the feel of mischievous student pranks. This was crossing a line. This was something they executed you for. They didn’t know what to do.

The safest thing, of course, would have been to walk away. Malaf said as much to Qaseh, but he didn’t hear her. He was lost to the world, calculating feverishly, which made Malaf very nervous. There was no denying that Qaseh was good at this: their last five successes were testament to that. But was ‘Big Q’ as good at assessing cannabis quality as he thought he was? Was he really so well informed about its street value? Or was this all self-delusion, a last-ditch attempt to save face and still get to play the criminal mastermind?

Eventually he seemed to come to a conclusion. “They’re asking too much,” he declared, and stomped off to negotiate.

An hour later they were on their way back to Ez Raam, their cars laden with bags of weed. Unlike the previous times they drove in silence, each aware of how devastating the consequences of a random police check would be.

They made it safely home, where Boraz had had the unenviable task of storing the product while Qaseh searched online for a buyer. This he did locked in his room, in silence, in the dark, while the others lay awake at night, listening for the sound of police cars.

Qaseh never explained how he made the contacts, what channels he’d had to go through. He told the others it was better if they didn’t know, and this time seemed genuinely to mean it. But that evening, he, Boraz and Tusham had travelled to an unfamiliar part of the city, to a slum the municipality had never quite managed to tear down, to an unnamed back alley, to a dark and vacant building. They had brought with them kitchen knives they knew they would not be competent to use in self-defence. They had taken three large gym bags stuffed with weed. They had returned, visibly shaking with exhaustion and relief, with cash.

Whether Qaseh had successfully gauged the price, or whether they had been cruelly ripped off, none of them cared to speculate. It was more than worth it for them to be rid of the stuff. Either way, they had earned more from this exchange than they had from all the previous others combined. It had been their first truly big score.

It would also be their last.

In the weeks that followed, a silence passed over the group. The time for their next deal approached, arrived, and passed without comment. The understanding spread wordlessly among them: their careers as smugglers were over.

Nobody discussed what they would do with their winnings. Nobody discussed any aspect of the trips at all, not even in whispers. It was as if, by not acknowledging it, they could have made it unhappen. By mutual, unspoken agreement, for the rest of their university life they avoided each other; first in public, and then online, as their chats became stilted and less frequent, and finally ceased altogether.

Malaf, who eventually completed her degree with a much lower grade than she knew she was capable of, used her share of the money to pay a small part of the deposit for an apartment, and started advertising as a translator in French and English.

Occasionally over the next few years Qaseh sent her emails asking how she was getting on. Her replies, which she made only rarely, were polite but uninterested. She understood from Qaseh’s reports that he, Boraz, Irooj and Tusham had started meeting up again. These meetings, carried out in private homes where nobody could overhear them, were, as Qaseh said, “mostly social” in nature; he left that as a dangling invitation for her to ask what new schemes they were getting up to, but Malaf refused to bite. It was something to do with pro-democracy online activism: obtaining and publishing sensitive documents. She didn’t care to learn more. Very rarely she would bump into one of the old crew and be unable to avoid a conversation. It seemed that their notorious past, those now-nauseating memories of their reckless youthful stupidity, was giving them something to reminisce over, to talk about – maybe even fondly. It was keeping them together – just as it was driving Malaf further away.

To the extent that it was possible in a country that made criminals of everyone, Malaf had gone straight.

But the rest of the gang, following Qaseh’s lead, had gone sideways.

---

\noindent Sitting in the Pasham Sixty with Irooj, it was hard to believe any of it had really happened – or that it had happened to *her*. Today’s Malaf knew that she was continuous with that younger version of herself; but could *she* really have acted the way *that* woman had?

The craziest thing about it was that she hadn’t even needed the money. It chilled her to realise this about herself, but she had done it, not because she had to, but because she *could.* Because she was clever and they, the Enemy, were stupid. She could get away with it. That was the sole reason. It had been a kind of destiny. She could no more have resisted it than she could have stopped being Malaf Sagheedi.

She wondered if she’d outgrown this tendency. Based on recent evidence, it seemed unlikely.

“These hills bring it all back, don’t they?”

She was startled by Irooj’s voice – and by how well she’d read her thoughts.

Because, although she hated the cliché, it really did feel as if no time had passed. These roads, these signposts with their familiar names. The feeling of – she couldn’t deny it – excitement, of freedom from the big city’s rules. The danger of it.

And she was curious to see if anything had changed, over the years, in the town that was their destination: a small, abandoned settlement near the Ramestani border. A place called Ez Nezeshti.

## III

She was still barefoot, which meant she could move silently. She took three soft backward steps away from the door and deeper into the darkness of her bedroom. But she’d left her shoes at the entrance to the apartment. There was no pretending she wasn’t home.

Whoever was in there with her would know they had her trapped.

Her apartment was small. There was nowhere to hide, not for long. It was also narrow: no way of sneaking past the intruder undetected. Run, then? Not with her ankle. She wouldn’t make it even to the stairwell at the end of the hallway. And talking her way out was out of the question. Her pursuers had already made their intentions clear.

Which only left fighting.

She had retreated as far as she could from the door. There was a vanity chest on her right hand side. The men who’d raided her apartment had pulled its drawers open and left them dangling agape; some had been pulled so hard they’d come out of the unit and spilled their contents on the floor. Socks, underwear. A pack of tampons. A friend had given her an ornate incense burner for a birthday present; she’d used it once and hated the smell of sandalwood. That had been knocked off the top of the vanity too, along with its supply of incense sticks and—

The cigarette lighter.

She got down on one knee to pick it up, her eyes never leaving the doorway. How many were they? She thought she’d only heard one set of footsteps. Could there be others waiting outside?

Also on the floor: a make-up box. Its contents scattered. Eyeliner, lipstick, mascara. Hairbrush. And next to it... where was it? *Where had it gone?*

She heard footsteps outside the room, getting closer.

She got down lower, put her head against the floor. There: it had rolled under the vanity. She stretched out an arm, snatched it up. The cool metal cylinder fitted snugly into her hand, as if millions of years of evolution had sculpted her palm and fingers solely to hold it. Comfortable: the way a gun felt.

A can of hairspray.

If there was only one man she had a chance. It would take her a few seconds to reach the stairwell. It would be a slow-motion, agonising half-run down the stairs, gripping the handrail and biting down the pain in her leg. Down the stairs, through the main entrance, onto the street. How long would that take? Thirty seconds? Ninety? That’s the length of time she’d need him to be incapacitated.

A jet of flame to the face. Blinding. A cotton shirt might catch fire if she was lucky. Hair. She needed panic. A thrashing confusion. Barrel into him. Knock him down, let him roll screaming while she bolted for the door.

Footsteps outside, heading her way.

The woman got quickly to her feet. She flicked the wheel of the lighter and got a flame on the first go. She angled the can of hairspray upwards, her finger on the button, ready to spray.

A figure stepped through the doorway into the light cast by the tiny flame.

“Hello?” the intruder said.

Surprise rattled through her brain. It was a *woman’s* voice...

“Are you all right?”

The intruder was indeed a woman, middle-aged, wearing an expression of confusion that matched that of the younger woman waiting in the bedroom. In both her hands she was holding what, improbably, appeared to be a slow cooker.

“You... you told me to bring this back...” the intruder said, weakly.

The woman in the bedroom heard the words, processed them sluggishly. When her breathing had stabilised to the point at which speech was again possible, she spoke the intruder’s name: “Maara?”

Simultaneously, the intruder spoke hers.

“Malaf?”

---

\noindent There was a coffee place not far from Malaf’s apartment; like most others, it would be open until past midnight. They went there.

The scene in the apartment had quickly descended into farce. For starters, both parties had had to come to terms with the facts that a) Maara had been snooping around in Malaf’s broken-into apartment, and b) Malaf had been caught in the act of apparently trying to set Maara on fire. There had followed a rushed (and quite unasked for) explanation of how Maara had knocked on Malaf’s door only to find that it swung open on its own, the lock having been damaged somehow; and that she had only gone in to confirm that Malaf wasn’t inside, perhaps injured in some way. Malaf, who had only wanted to get them both out of the apartment as quickly as possible, had nodded her way through this, only half listening, making encouraging noises as required. Then there was the difficulty in persuading Maara to let Malaf leave the apartment unattended. Shouldn’t they be waiting for the police to arrive? Or at least calling a locksmith to fix the door? Malaf, who was practically shoving her over the threshold at this point, explained only half-jokingly that there was nothing of value left to steal anymore.

“We have to go,” Malaf finally pleaded. “*Please.*”

They left the slow cooker sitting on the floor in the kitchen.

Maara, on the way: “You’re walking funny.”

“Well observed.”

“Is it your leg? What happened?”

“I fell off a roof.”

“You’re not making any sense.”

The coffee place was new on the scene, put together in a hip Western style young people liked. The music was loud and in English, and there were stickers on the walls reminding people to wear their headscarves correctly, a dead giveaway of a recent raid by the Guards. Malaf had been here only once before, and had paid no mind to how exposed people were, sitting on the long benches facing the full-length windows looking right onto the street. She steered Maara deeper into the café, to where the lights had been dimmed to create a sense of intimacy. They found a booth whose table was littered with used plastic cups, and swept those aside to make space. Malaf set the backpack full of clothes and money on the bench beside her, leaning it against her thigh so she could always feel the gentle pressure and know that her lifeline was still intact.

Maara returned from the bar with two coffees. Malaf sipped hers gratefully. She avoided Maara’s questioning look. Her eyes kept flicking over to the window, scanning the street, watching the people walk by.

“So you’ve had a rough day, huh?” Maara tried.

Malaf gave her a flat stare.

Maara sighed. “Malaf, I don’t know what’s happened to you. You look... well, you look like you’ve been in a fight, or a car crash or something. And your flat. Malaf, what’s wrong?”

Malaf made a sad, helpless gesture, remaining mute. She was so very tired, so tired and desperately alone.

“Please, Malaf. Is there something I can do? Any way I can help you?”

Malaf said nothing for a long moment. Then she put her coffee cup down. She did it carefully, precisely, as if aligning it to some invisible grid. Finally she spoke.

“I don’t know where to begin,” Malaf said, quietly, so that nobody could overhear her. “I need you to tell me something.”

Maara nodded slowly.

“I need to know what everyone’s saying,” Malaf said, “about how Lineh died.”

\vspace*{50px}

## I


Malaf was awoken by an unfamiliar notification sound from her mobile. She jerked upright in a state of abject confusion. Where was she? And why was she in bed fully clothed?

It took her a moment to align herself. She was back in her apartment on Raga Siyanesh (Martyr) Street. The sun was high in the sky behind the curtains. She checked her watch and found she’d been asleep for less than two hours. Feeling not much rested, but aware that she probably wouldn’t go back to sleep, she decided that the best thing she could do now was to dedicate the remainder of the day to identifying whatever person or persons had sent the message that had woken her, and murdering them.

She checked her phone. It was Qaseh.

> **vVHISPER ADMIN** Hi Malaf! Someone you know has invited you to join **vVhisper**, the anonymous messenger app. Click **here** to install.

“Fuck off, Qaseh,” Malaf mumbled, but installed the app anyway. Within a few minutes of joining, she received contact requests from Irooj, Tusham, Boraz and Abeej. The timing suggested they were all in a room together, tapping away on their phones. Coordinating, colluding. Preparing their next big strike in the name of democracy and free speech, no doubt.

Malaf tossed her phone onto the other side of the bed to be away from it. *That* was something that irritated her: their belief that the regime, the mullahs, the economy, the censorship, the corruption and brutality of the Guards, were nothing more than glitches to be fixed in the country’s source code. These societal problems were issues that they could file bug reports for, and download patches to solve. Peace was just an app away: social media platforms, VPNs, electronic ballots, public-key encryption, anonymous messaging, cryptocurrencies. Every new tech innovation that came along was absolutely, positively going to be *the one* that would make the difference.

There was undeniably something likeable in the tenacity with which they held those ideas, especially in the face of so much evidence to the contrary. And she knew, from personal experience, how seductive the dream of a technological utopia could be. If anything, Malaf had believed in it more firmly than Qaseh had when they were students. She too had dreamed that self-organising networks, through thought alone, might one day topple the weary giants of flesh and steel. But time had passed, and the networks had not lived up to their promise – ultimately, it seemed, because sooner or later your fancy app, your liberating lines of code, ran up against men with guns, who would kill you, and your family, without the slightest trace of remorse if you made it worth their while to do so.

Sighing, Malaf got out of bed and headed towards the kitchen. She made a pot of dangerously strong coffee and turned on the TV. She flicked through the Ramestani channels, watching with little interest what passed for news here. On other channels, mullahs hectored their viewers. Even now, days after the event, they were still talking about the Supreme Leader missing his weekly televised prayers. Imam Boraqashti himself had been dragged out of whatever cave he slept in, and was spelling it out to his audience. Rumours about Our Beloved Leader’s ill health were nothing more than Zionist propaganda, spread by the USA to destabilise the country. Malaf yawned, and changed to satellite to watch foreign channels: BBC, Al Jazeera, CNN. Owning a satellite dish was illegal, but that didn’t stop every building in Ez Raam from having several, and Malaf had purchased cracked codes to unlock almost every news channel on Earth.

She watched and drank coffee until she felt her brain starting to work again. Her phone made another noise: a message from Qaseh, sent over vVhisper. She ignored it, and headed for the shower.

---

\noindent You could walk past the entrance to Café Kesh and not notice it. Situated on the roof of a shop that sold upmarket speaker systems, it was accessed by a long, narrow, metal staircase that had been bolted onto the side of the building. The staircase was sturdy enough, but there was an improvised feel to it, as if the shisha bar had crash-landed onto the roof and this was its emergency exit. Upstairs, Café Kesh turned out to be a large space with tables and divans sitting in the open air. A combination of parasols and clear plastic sheeting could make the whole area more or less rainproof when needed, and in evenings the customers were kept warm by the pale blue flames of heaters endlessly burning cheap gas.

When Malaf arrived, the French speaking evening was well underway. Apart from a few people smoking alone or in pairs around the fringes, everybody here was someone she knew. A few had taken board games from the pile in the corner. Mancala was a popular choice, with its simple rules and fast turnaround. There was backgammon, too, and a chess set, though chess was a serious matter in Ramestan: you had fun, or you played chess, and played to win; never both. There was even a cheap Ramestani knock-off of Scrabble, which Malaf had never seen played: it didn’t really work with the Rami alphabet, and none of them spoke enough English to play with Western tiles.

She stood at the doorway scanning the faces. When she saw Lineh wasn’t here, she went to the bar to pick up a disposable mouthpiece and then walked over to the nearest divan, where a group of four were taking turns on the hookah and chatting.

“*Bonsoir,*” she said with a smile. “*Puis-je vous joindre?*”

“*Bien sûr!*”

“*Salut, Malaf.*”

Malaf kicked off her shoes and crawled onto the divan. She had learned French from her mother, who had lived a long time in Algeria before settling in Ramestan. She had died during the war when Malaf was a child – killed not by a falling bomb, but in a car crash, perfectly ordinary and arbitrary and somehow more tragic for that. All Malaf’s translation work was done on the written word, and she had few reasons apart from these evenings to speak French out loud. When she did, it was impossible not to feel a kind of renewal of the connection between her and her mother, a woman of whom she had fewer memories than she would have liked.

She accepted the hose from the woman sitting cross-legged beside her, screwed in her mouthpiece and took a few long, easy pulls of apple-flavoured smoke. As she did she gestured to one of the staff and signalled for a round of sweet tea for everyone, on her.

“So, Malaf,” said her neighbour, a woman named Qateena, in Rami-accented French. “We haven’t seen you in ages. How have you been?”

“Busy,” Malaf told her. She blew smoke into the sky and passed back the hose. “I had a big project, couldn’t make time. Some old biddy from America wanted her self-published novel translated into Rami, but the thing was so badly in need of an editor I had to translate it into English first.”

This got a laugh. Like all the best lies, it could easily have been true: such clients were an unending source of misery for Malaf. But in reality her schedule had been clear. Her reasons for avoiding Café Kesh had been rather more complicated, and were most definitely not for public consumption.

Malaf sat and smoked and talked, and kept an eye on the entrance waiting for Lineh to make an appearance.

Daran, a young man who spoke French reasonably well and came to the club to meet girls, was telling a story about a recent skiing trip in the north of the country. Malaf half listened, her gaze sweeping over the shisha bar. As she did, an unconscious social calculation was being performed in some quiet corner of her brain.

Take a woman’s face in profile, and draw a line from the bottom of her chin vertically upwards to her forehead. Let this be your baseline. A headscarf wrapping from the back of the head up to this line would leave only the face exposed, and would cover the entirety of the woman’s hair in the manner demanded by the mullahs and enforced Guards. Now, when a woman actually put on a headscarf, it was indeed true that some portion of her hair would be covered, but this coverage would not be total. Usually the scarf would sit somewhere further back – perhaps so far back that only the hair at the very back of her head was covered. Measure the angle by which the headscarf diverges from the baseline, and one could make reasonable inferences about the woman’s attitudes to religion, politics, sex, travel, the government, the media... Most importantly, it allowed you to gauge how much hair *you* could expose, how many buttons on your jacket you could undo – and what kind of things you could or could not say out loud.

It was the kind of assessment, vital to one’s long-term survival, that one constantly did without thinking in Ramestan. Looking around, Malaf saw women with scarves so loose they were barely covering the shoulders, and she knew that she could talk more freely here than she could on the street. Just a few minutes’ walk from here, she knew, the vibe would be very different. In a café in a less affluent, less travelled, more working-class district, Malaf would unthinkingly transform. She would become quieter, cagier; would walk differently, would make subtle adjustments to her clothing, especially her headscarf. After more than thirty-five years of Ramestani life, it was second nature to her. She wouldn’t even be aware she was doing it.

Of course, every woman had a different idea of what constituted modest dress in the nation’s capital. So a sociologist might go to Ez Raam’s teeming bazaar and, armed with a clipboard and discrete video camera, measure the amount of hair covered by the headscarves of thousands of women. A histogram of the data would show two distinct humps: a more liberal one and a more conservative one. At the high liberal end: young teenage girls in lipstick and skinny jeans, as well as older women who didn’t mind running the risk of being given a hard time by the Guards. At the other extreme were women who thought the headscarf wasn’t enough, and instead wore long black gowns with a hood incorporated: conservatives, true believers – or women who had to pretend to be, or else lose their jobs.

When Daran’s story wound down, Malaf asked him, in French, if he had seen Lineh at all recently.

“Lovely Lineh!” Daran said with a grin. “Missing your Café Kesh board game partner?”

“Something like that.”

“I have a backgammon set of my own back at my place if you ever want some *real* fun, eh?”

“Thanks Daran, but I like my games to last more than five minutes.”

Daran laughed, saluted her with his tea cup.

“Now I come to think of it,” he said, after a moment, “where *is* Lineh? She’s been away a few weeks, hasn’t she?”

He looked to the others for confirmation. They nodded, though with some uncertainty, since Lineh hadn’t been much of a participant in the meetings and could easily have passed unnoticed. Malaf, who had access to better information, knew it for a fact: Lineh had skipped the last three sessions. It didn’t look like she’d be coming to this one either.

“I guess none of you has spoken with her?”

They all shook their heads. Daran said, “Maara’s the one to ask. Over there. She knows Lineh pretty well, I think.”

Malaf said “Oh really?” as if this was news to her, but of course she was already aware of it. Maara knew Lineh because they worked in the same office. In fact, it was Maara who had first brought Lineh to Café Kesh.

Malaf smoked some more, listening idly to others’ conversations with eyes roving, searching. When she spotted Maara standing up from her table across the room, Malaf knocked back the last of her tea, excused herself, and got up to intercept the other woman at the bar.

“Oh, hello Malaf,” Maara said in Rami. They embraced briefly, air-kissed either cheek.

“*Bonsoir, Maara,*” Malaf corrected her, playfully, but with a purpose. If they were speaking French, the barman wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop.

“*Si tu insistes,*” Maara said with a smile.

Maara was in her mid forties, recently divorced from a husband who worked in the oil business. She liked translated American romance novels, fake tans, holidays in Dubai; disliked politics, history, and office gossip of which she was not the broker. She never took shisha, citing allergies, but happily sat with the others drinking tea or fruit juice. Malaf and Maara both ordered cakes and some more tea. Since they had come to the bar together, there followed the usual battle of which could outdo the other in their attempts not to let the other one pay, eventually won by Maara.

“It’s good to see you again. It’s been ages,” she said. “If you’d told me, I’d have brought your slow cooker.”

“Take it over to my apartment some evening,” Malaf said. “You remember where I live, right?”

“Sure. I’ll call to make sure you’re in.”

“Don’t bother,” Malaf said. “If I’m not here I’m at home translating. That’s how exciting my life is. Either that or getting arrested.”

Maara laughed. “You’re funny.”

Malaf winked at her. “I sure am,” she replied.

“We should get together and have another meal at your place,” Maara suggested. “Malaf, you’re such a good cook, when are you getting a husband?”

“I don’t really see the connection, but, well, whenever supply meets demand, I suppose.”

“Young Daran there is single,” Maara said with a wink, elbowing Malaf playfully in the ribs.

“Thanks, but I wouldn’t want to deprive the womenfolk of Ramestan of his attentions. It would be selfish of me.”

They found an empty table and set their cups down. Each cup came with a wooden stirrer stick onto which sugar had been crystallised: their lower halves were wrapped in a weird geometry of brown cubes at odd angles. Malaf liked her tea bitter and dipped her sugar stick in only briefly, while Maara kept stirring hers until most of the sugar had dissolved.

“I wonder if you know whether Lineh might come tonight?” Malaf asked Maara.

“No idea, love,” Maara said. “She hasn’t come in weeks.”

“Really? Why not?”

“She hasn’t said. I guess she just isn’t getting much out of it. Languages aren’t really her strong point, she told me.”

“Fair enough,” Malaf asked. “How is she doing?”

Maara shrugged. “I haven’t seen her in a while, actually.”

“Really?” Leaning forward, voice even. “Why not?”

“Oh, she’s got the flu, the poor thing. She’s been off all week.”

Malaf kept the neutral expression fixed on her face like a butterfly pinned to a board in a museum. “That’s awful,” she said. “Have you spoken to her at all?”

“Not since she got ill. I did try calling her, to see if she wanted anything, but she didn’t reply.”

“I see.” Malaf smiled. “I’m sure she’s all right.”

Meanwhile her mind was racing. *How do you know she’s ill? Could she be faking? Could she have got worse and gone to hospital? Do you know this through work? Did she call you? Send you an email? Send someone else an email and they told you? Could that person be lying? Covering for her?*

Malaf needed answers, and she realised she wouldn’t get any without giving something in return. This didn’t come easily to her after so much caginess, but she made it sound casual.

“I saw her recently.”

Malaf felt her revelation should have echoed across the city like a cannon blast, but Maara simply said, “Oh yes?”

“Yes, she invited me over for a cup of tea,” Malaf said. She said it well. She had rehearsed it. “It was before she got ill, I suppose. Probably she didn’t mention it.”

“No, she didn’t.”

Malaf hoped the relief she felt didn’t show on her face.

“I wonder,” she went on, trying not to look like she was watching Maara’s reactions very closely indeed, “when you last saw her, did she seem, I don’t know... *upset* at all?”

Maara frowned. “What’s with all these questions about Lineh? Is something wrong?”

Malaf fought the instinct to look around quickly and make sure nobody could hear her. “I’m just wondering if Lineh really *is* ill. Because I think... I think there could be some other reason she hasn’t come into work.”

Maara frowned. “What do you mean?”

“I’m not sure,” Malaf said. “It’s just... the last time I saw her, she seemed stressed about something.”

“Stress is a killer,” Maara said, nodding wisely. “She should have said. We could have gone meditating together. I have some new crystals.”

Malaf regarded Maara warily. She never knew how to react when the topic of crystals came up in conversation. Maara’s interest in energies, horoscopes and various other forms of quackery appalled Malaf. Maara knew this, and Malaf was beginning to suspect the woman was hamming it up, deliberately, to tease her.

“So you reckon that’s why she’s taking the time off?” Maara asked. “Stress?”

“I honestly don’t know.”

“Weeeeell,” Maara said, leaning forward and dropping her voice a little, “I can’t think of anything she might be stressed about, work-wise...”

Malaf took what she was being offered. “But *outside* work?”

Maara looked shifty all of a sudden, and Malaf could see that she was torn. She knew something and wanted to tell someone; would do it, if she could justify it to herself. But she liked Lineh, and there were certain kinds of gossip that could be dangerous. Malaf herself didn’t want to ask it, but she needed to know what Maara knew.

“Is Lineh...” Feeling her heartbeat go up a gear, she lowered her voice even further. “...*seeing someone?*”

The words rocked Maara back in her chair. She looked flustered even to have heard them. “Lineh is a nice girl...”

Malaf pressed her lips together. This was tiresome. *Yes,* Lineh was a nice girl. *Yes,* sex outside marriage was illegal. *No,* a well-mannered lady like Maara would never even *suspect* such a thing of an acquaintance, the thought would never cross her *mind,* would never even have *occurred* to her. And even if that *was* what she suspected, she would *never* muddy the name of a sweet young girl like Lineh.

And yet...

“She did mention that a man was... bothering her.”

“Bothering her?”

“She didn’t want to talk about it,” Maara said. It was almost a whisper. “But I got the impression that she wanted nothing to do with him. He was calling her up at night, pestering her.”

“And you’re sure she was talking about a man?”

“Oh yes. She even had a name for him: Mr Starfish.”

Malaf frowned. “Mr *Starfish?*”

“That’s what she called him. Funny sort of nickname, isn’t it?”

\noindent The metro train screamed through its underground darkness, hissing and rattling, electricity sparking between the wheels and the tracks. The garbled voice announcing the stations couldn’t compete: the tape-recorded messages, worn down after years of replaying, might as well have been in code.

As a student in a dormitory, Malaf had had trouble sleeping. Once, in desperation, she had recorded ninety minutes of static from a radio tuned between channels, and had started wearing her headphones to bed so that she could drown out the sounds from outside. Here was no different. The noise on the train was so incessant that it disappeared. Sometimes she felt that it was only down here, in these tunnels, that she could hear herself think.

She thought about Lineh.

For the first time she wondered if something terrible might have happened to her.

She took her phone out of her handbag. She had no signal down here, but a notification light was blinking – had been blinking, ignored, since earlier that afternoon. It was the vVhisper message Qaseh had sent earlier. Sighing, she opened it.

> **QASEH J:** If Lineh shows up today, ask her if she knows Ros Khesri.

Malaf frowned. *Ros Khesri?* Who the hell was he?

And more to the point, why did Qaseh care?

## II

A breath of air that had earlier stirred up dust devils in the arid flats now tugged at a child’s swing by a roadside diner. Unusually, what the swing was dangling from was the gun barrel of a main battle tank.

Years ago, in the early stages of the war, the Ramestani army had come through here on its way to the front lines. Its armoured vehicles, built long ago and poorly maintained, had fared badly on the battlefields. Many, such as this one, hadn’t even made it that far, succumbing to mechanical faults *en route*. Those worth fixing had been fixed; those that weren’t had been left rusting where they lay.

This broken-down tank had been discarded in a village of a similarly throwaway nature: a loose collection of buildings at a crossroads, where at various times various families had tried to make a living off passing travellers. Shops and houses had been put up, lived in for a while, then abandoned when no longer profitable, often to be reclaimed by others. The only part that seemed to have any kind of permanence was the diner, which milked the novelty of the dead tank beside it for all it was worth. Every passing kid wanted a ride on the swing, and the ice cream was on sale at monopoly prices.

Irooj pulled the Sixty into the diner’s parking lot. Malaf got out and stretched from side to side at the hips until each of her vertebrae had slotted back into position.

Apart from the tank, there was one other vehicle parked there. Malaf, still sore all over, thought of its comfortable passenger seating with envy. Irooj caught the look and made a hurt face.

“She loves you really,” she told the Sixty, patting its roof affectionately.

---

\noindent Inside: the smell of oil and cooked meat. A TV in the corner showed a news channel, although there wasn’t much to see except live footage of the outside of the hospital. Music, turned down. The tables and chairs were cheap plastic, and the floor was spongy lino made slightly slippery by a constant fall of aerosolised grease. The walls were sparsely decorated with wartime memorabilia. Faded pictures showed tanks riding into battle. A newspaper front page, framed, announced a famous victory. Photos of young men on their way to be martyred. Replicas of artillery shells, full size in brass, showed the kind of thing the tank outside might one day have fired.

When Malaf pushed open the door, an electronic chime alerted the owner, who emerged from the kitchen with a wide smile. He pointed out an empty table for them, but Malaf declined with a curt wave, and went to join the only other customers in the diner.

“Hello, comrades,” Qaseh said cheerfully. Malaf noted that his wrists were still red and raw from when he’d been tied up. “How was the drive?”

“I think Malaf would rather ride shotgun in the tank,” Irooj told them. Abeej and Boraz scooted their chairs aside so she could sit with Tusham. “Hey handsome,” she said, squeezing his hand. She didn’t kiss him: it didn’t feel like that kind of place where that would be allowed. “What’s on the menu?”

Tusham dabbed the corners of his mouth with a napkin. He put on his plummiest accent. “I can attest that the lamb kebabs are delicious, and the garlic sauce is especially piquant today.”

“The only challenge is finding the right vintage of grape juice to pair it with,” Boraz opined.

“The portions could be bigger,” Tusham added. He was already on his second plate. Irooj patted his arm playfully.

Malaf offered to order for Irooj, and headed for the bar. Qaseh called to her in a loud whisper: “Remember, our cover story is that we’re smugglers and pro-democracy activists!”

Malaf thought about the gun in her car, and wished Qaseh would shut the hell up.

While she waited to be served, Malaf watched the TV. There was, of course, only one thing on air: their Supreme Leader’s desperate fight for life.

It was less than twenty-four hours since the old man had been found unconscious in his residence. As was well-known in Ez Raam, the Supreme Leader had a small army of live-in doctors and nurses on standby for emergencies; but this was clearly something more than they could handle. Fortunately his helicopter had been recently refuelled and ready to fly, saving those critical few minutes in getting him to the hospital. There he remained. Few additional details were being reported; those that were, one could believe as much as anything else the media said. It was claimed that he was still alive. That he was in excellent shape for a man of his age. That the surgeons were the best in the world. That God was watching over him.

Malaf wondered if God had dropped any hints yet about possible successors.

She looked around to see that Abeej was joining her at the bar, an empty cup in his hand. “Time for a refill,” he explained.

“How’s it going?” she asked him.

“All good. They’re *strategising*,” he told her. From the tone of his voice, the implication was that *Qaseh* was doing the strategising, in exhaustive detail, and everyone else thought it best to just sit back and listen. “You see that?” he asked, pointing to a space above the bar.

Malaf saw a rectangular patch of the wall where the wallpaper was paler than its surroundings. A small hole had been drilled near its top end. It was obvious what this was: most businesses in Ramestan had a portrait of the Supreme Leader looking out over its customers. It wasn’t actually compulsory, but it was wise to play safe in case you found yourself serving a member of the Guards. This was where the diner’s one had been hung, until recently.

“Wow,” Malaf said. “That’s a bit premature, isn’t it?”

“That’s what we thought at first,” Abeej said, quietly. “But then we looked out the window. The owner’s wife is praying to it.”

“I see.” Without thinking about it Malaf adjusted her headscarf, pulling it forward and tightening it over her hair. She felt suddenly the way Ez Raamers often did on trips outside the capital: that she could travel to a different country – a different planet, even – without leaving Ramestan. All she had to do was to take one step out of her liberal urban bubble, and she was as much a foreigner as any American tourist.

“So,” Abeej asked. “How do you feel about all this?”

Malaf thought a moment. “Well, I don’t exactly *wish* him dead...”

“No no,” Abeej interrupted quickly, his eyes flicking nervously to the door to the kitchen, where the owner might have been overheard them. “I meant, about going to Ez Nezeshti. About being on the road again, after all this time.”

“Oh!” Malaf shrugged. “I’m glad to be out of the city. I needed some time to think about things.”

Abeej tutted at her.

“What? Have I missed the point?”

“I mean *about being with us again.* The old crew, reunited.” He grinned. “I guess we must all have changed a lot since then, right?”

Malaf nodded, but only out of politeness. The embarrassing truth was that she didn’t remember much about Abeej in terms of personality. He had joined the crew at a late stage, invited in on the scheme by Qaseh – the excesses of whose own personality tended to swamp those around him. She remembered Abeej being quiet, introverted, and also cautious. On their last trip, after things had escalated dramatically beyond their intended risk level, Abeej had argued strongly against getting further involved. The fact that he had spoken out at all had itself been surprising, so accustomed had they become to his quietness. The only thing she remembered about him that really stood out was...

“Do you still do marathons?”

“Marathons?” Abeej laughed. “That was never me. I only ever managed halves. Now I’m lucky if I can do 5K without wheezing myself to death. And you, you did... rowing, wasn’t it?”

Malaf reddened briefly at the recollection. “Oh,” she said. “No, I only did that for a bit. I didn’t even last a whole semester. I’m surprised you remember.”

“Of course I do. I remember thinking: where do you row a boat in Ez Raam?”

“I remind you, Ez Raam has an excellent network of gutters.”

Abeej laughed. “You should get back into it, though. It’s good to stay healthy.”

“Yes, well, on the topic of taking care of one’s health,” Malaf said, reaching behind herself and squeezing the sore spots in her spine, “do you reckon Tusham would be up for swapping with me to ride with Irooj?”

“I think Tusham would swap with you to ride with Satan himself to get away from Qaseh’s music collection.”

“So *that* hasn’t changed, then.”

Abeej chuckled again. Then he leaned closer, leaned in. “You know, I always wondered...”

“Yes?”

“Whether there was ever any, you know, *thing* going on with you and Qaseh.”

“Dear God,” Malaf moaned, “what is wrong with you people?”

“Huh. I guess Irooj must have asked you too. Well, you can’t blame us for thinking it.”

“We argued *constantly,*” Malaf complained. “And don’t you dare tell me we were sublimating pent-up desires that could only be worked out through argument, because I assure you, it’s because he was an ass who talked about Marx like he didn’t know Karl from Groucho.”

“I know. We loved to watch the fireworks. Remember the time when he got you started on Rosa Luxemburg? And you told him...”

Abeej went on, but Malaf had stopped listening. She was watching the TV.

The screen was showing an interview with Ebri Hoz, a minor figure in the Ramestani parliament. He had good PR and pushed reformist ideas, which made him popular with young people. Malaf had met him, briefly, and knew him to be slimy and conniving even by the high standards set by Ramestani politicians, her own father (presumably) excepted. Hoz was busy relaying the messages God had communicated to him during his prayers for the Supreme Leader’s speedy recovery.

“...and of course there must be no ill words said against good and holy men such as Imam Raz Boraqashti,” he was saying, referring to a senior and famously hardline cleric, also from Ez Takhab, “who have not yet made time to publicly pray with us. Our kind and humble Leader would not wish for Boraqashti to desert his important, local duties, even at a time of emergency like this. Despite his absence, I know Imam Boraqashti is deeply moved.”

Such sincerity, such electable candour. One could almost hear Boraqashti fuming.

Malaf watched without seeing, without hearing. Instead, she was reading the words on the ticker scrolling from one side to the other at the bottom of the screen. While the Supreme Leader’s life hung in the balance, this narrow strip was all the space that could be allotted to the news from the rest of the world. Stories that would otherwise have occupied long segments of airtime were compressed to single sentences, played once across the screen, then forgotten about.

Malaf caught only a few words, but it was enough.

*...HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LINEH PARKIESH, 26, WHO WORKED AS...*

She heard Abeej say something, maybe Malaf’s name. Abeej was facing away from the screen. He hadn’t seen it. Nobody had. And now that the words had passed, nobody ever would.

“Hmm?” Malaf made herself say.

“I said, are you all right? You don’t look so good.”

*I’m fine.* The words arrived in her mind as if from outside. She formed her lips into the right shapes. If sound came out she didn’t hear it. The world was buzzing like a tuning fork.

“Where are you going?” Abeej asked.

Because Malaf was already walking.

*I’ll be right back,* she might have said.

---

\noindent Malaf stepped out of the diner into air hotter than the air-conditioned interior. She walked. Gravel crunched under her feet. She felt it rather than heard. Still the ringing noise in her ears.

Turned right, tracked around the side of the building. Trailing one hand on the red brick wall. The roughness scraping her fingertips.

Beside the diner was a small wooden shed, painted flaking white. A hand-written sign above the door said *prayer room*.

As she walked towards it the door opened. A woman wearing a black gown emerged, head down, her face streaked with tears. The owner’s wife. Chanting quietly. She was holding the framed photo of the Supreme Leader to her breast, clutching it as one would a sick baby. Lost in thoughts and prayers, she nearly collided with Malaf as they passed each other.

Malaf caught the door just before it swung shut. She stepped inside.

The floor of the prayer room was dusty carpet. Prayer mats were rolled up in one corner beside a bookshelf stocked with Qur’ans. An arrow showed the qiblah. Malaf took off her shoes, pushed them tidily to the side, squared their toes neatly. Then she knelt down. Her back ached dully.

She breathed.

Very slowly, very deliberately, she unlooped the headscarf from around her hair. She held it in hands that were only just beginning to shake. She examined the fabric carefully, felt its thickness. No, this was not enough.

She folded the cloth in half. Slow, deliberate. Better, she thought, but still not enough.

In half again, and in half again. Twisted it into a rope of fabric. There. Yes, she thought. This was thick enough for her purposes. This would suffice.

Holding both ends bunched up in her fists, she brought the tightly wrapped band to her face, opened her mouth, and bit down hard on it.

She slumped onto her side, curled up so her back was to the door. She sank her teeth into the gag, clenching her jaw on it as if to tear it to shreds.

*...HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LINEH PARKIESH...*

And there, lying on the floor of the prayer room, in total silence, Malaf screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed.

## III

“She was strangled,” Maara said, her voice barely audible above the noise of the café. “The police didn’t tell us much, but they told us that. They found her on Akhara Hill.”

Malaf nodded. Akhara Hill: a nature reserve on the south side of the city. Accessible by car: that must have been how they moved the body. Popular with tourists, but those tended to stay to the paths. In the wooded bits, a well-hidden body could lie there undiscovered for months. For Lineh to have been found so soon, her killer must have been unlucky, or had slipped up.

“When did you find out?” Malaf asked quietly.

“Yesterday,” Maara said. “The police came to the office and took statements. Only from a couple of us. Malaf, she’d been missing over a week. We thought she was ill. We thought...” She stopped, took a deep breath. “Lineh hurt no one. Who would do this to her?”

Malaf said nothing.

“I called you as soon as the police left,” Maara went on. “You didn’t pick up.”

“I lost my phone,” Malaf explained. “A couple of days ago. I don’t know where it is.” The hotel staff probably still had it. Unless they’d handed it over to the people chasing her.

“As soon as the police left I called a few of the others from Café Kesh,” Maara said. “Daran. A couple of others. They didn’t know anything about it. It looks like the police aren’t going to talk to them. Why aren’t they doing that? Why aren’t they talking to *everyone?* It’s like they don’t *care.*”

Malaf nodded slowly, tracing the rim of her coffee cup with a finger. When had *she* known that Lineh was truly dead? It depended on one’s definition of *known*. There had been that instant, watching TV in the diner, when the last of the veils of uncertainty she had tried to hide behind had been torn away. But she had *known* long before then; she’d had access to all the facts, and knew what they added up to. And before even that, before she could possibly have amassed sufficient evidence to draw a conclusion, she had known, in her deep, intuitive core, that Lineh was gone forever. Knowing was a process, not an event.

And now she knew something more. Maara had spoken a word that in one sense added nothing, but that fleshed out the truth and made it more immediate, more visceral, more repugnantly real.

*Strangled.* Lineh Parkiesh had been *strangled.*

A phrase, heard once in some long-forgotten US crime series, drifted in from a dusty corner of her brain: strangulation causes the capillaries in the eye to burst. A tiny, throwaway detail. She imagined Lineh fighting for breath. The pressure of trapped blood building up behind her eyes. Tiny blood vessels, splitting open, staining the whites of her eyes red as she died.

Malaf blinked. Maara had said something to her. “Sorry. What did you say?”

“I said, where have you been?”

“I was way out near the border,” Malaf whispered. “A town called—”

She’d written its name. She’d brought this on them.

“Well,” she said. “You wouldn’t have heard of it. It was with some... people I used to know.” There was grit in her voice, huskiness. She cleared her throat, tasting bile.

“What were you doing there?”

“I was—” *Hiding. Running.* “—helping them with a project they were working on. They wanted to...” She snorted, almost a laugh. “To make a movie.”

“You got hurt. Your leg.”

“I survived.” She tried to make a joke of it. Yes, she had survived. *But the others...*

Maara nodded. They sat in silence for a while, Maara wondering about her next line of attack, Malaf too mentally drained to prepare a defence against it.

“And while you were away, someone broke into your home,” Maara said at last. “Why are we sitting here, Malaf? Why haven’t you called the police?”

“I can’t call the police,” Malaf whispered, staring down at the tabletop. “I just can’t, Maara. Not for this.”

For a few seconds it looked like Maara might try asking her why not. But the fact was that life in Ramestan gave one so many reasons not to talk to the police. It made a criminal of everyone. There was a face you presented to the world, and a life you locked away inside your apartment and told nobody about. Maara could have made any number of guesses. Alcohol? Drugs? A secret boyfriend? And Malaf had seemed such a sweet girl...

“Tell me it’s complicated,” Maara said. “Tell me it’s better if I don’t know.”

Malaf shook her head, tired beyond all reckoning. “It’s complicated,” she said, softly. “It’s better if you don’t know.”

Maara let out a long, slow exhale. She placed both hands flat on the table, fingers spread. Malaf watched her do it.

“Do you need somewhere to stay?” Maara asked, finally. “Just for tonight,” she added, as if afraid she might have offered too much.

\vspace*{50px}

## I

*Hi Lineh. It’s been a week now since anyone saw you. I’m trying again. I just want to know you’re safe. Please reply to this, even if it’s only a word.*

Malaf looked at the words on her phone’s screen, the message written but unsent, her thumb hovering just over the *send* button. She thought about deleting the whole thing. But if she admitted it was pointless, what other dark thoughts would she be forced to confront?

She sent the message. Then, after much deliberation, and after having put it off as long as she could, she opened vVhisper. She’d used a lot of messenger apps over the years, rotating them as they came and went from fashion – a cycle accelerated by the government’s ongoing project of DDoSing them into oblivion whenever they would work out how. This app’s interface was by far the ugliest and least intuitive she had used. One thing Malaf understood that Qaseh didn’t: his dream of technological utopia would be going nowhere until the hackers partnered up with a half-decent UX consultant. After an eternity of stabs in the dark she finally got a secure message sent.

> **9.10 AM: MALAF S OPENS CONVERSATION**
>
> **Invited: QASEH J**
>
>**MALAF S:** All right, drama queen, I give in. Who’s Ros Khesri?
>
> **9.12 AM: QASEH J JOINS CONVERSATION**
>
> **QASEH J:** Did your friend show up, then?
>
> **MALAF S:** No. As far as I can tell, the last anyone saw her was Saturday evening.
>
> **QASEH J:** Well, as I said I’m incredibly busy right now. We’re planning a trip, the lot of us. You wouldn’t believe where.
>
> **QASEH J:** (And, by the way, the invitation to join us still stands.)
>
> **QASEH J:** But, since it’s you, I’ll divert some of my painfully limited resources and put out some feelers for her. Maybe I’ll get lucky.

Malaf wrote out a message saying she neither needed or wanted his help, then deleted it. Because yes, she *did* want his help, *did* need it.

Instead, she wrote:

> **MALAF S:** So: who’s Ros Khesri?
>
> **QASEH J:** Do you seriously expect me to believe you haven’t already googled him?
>
> **MALAF S:** Of course I have. And found nothing. Just an old academic in Ez Takhab. Unless you’ve suddenly developed a rapt interest in geology professors, I’m going to assume you don’t mean him.
>
> **QASEH J:** Actually, that Khesri *is* our Khesri. He’s been on our radar for a while now.
>
> **MALAF S:** Really? Why him?
>
> **QASEH J:** Yeah. Part of a wider investigation. Forget about it, though. It was a million to one shot.
>
> **MALAF S:** Why should Lineh know Khesri?
>
> **QASEH J:** Probably she doesn’t. We have a file on Khesri’s activities. People he’s worked with, places he’s gone. Once upon a time he was hired as a consultant for PetRaam, the oil company.
>
> **QASEH J:** Anyway, after our chat yesterday, I looked up Lineh Parkiesh online. I found out where she works, and the company name rang a bell.
>
> **MALAF S:** But Lineh doesn’t work for PetRaam.
>
> **QASEH J:** Her company did business with them. Accountancy, financial services. It was years ago though. Probably before Lineh joined. It’s all very tenuous. I shouldn’t have mentioned it.
>
> **MALAF S:** Why are you investigating Khesri?
>
> **QASEH J:** We’re not. He’s not a key player. Just a name on the periphery. Our investigation goes much, much further than him.
>
> **MALAF S:** Okay. Thanks.
>
> **QASEH J:** Well?
>
> **MALAF S:** Well what?
>
> **QASEH J:** Aren’t you going to ask me what this is all about? This big project we’re working on? And this mysterious upcoming trip to which I have so enigmatically alluded? Go on. Don’t be shy.
>
> **9.19 AM: MALAF S LEAVES THE CONVERSATION**

---

\noindent “Teneligliptin? Bortezomib?”

“Febuxostat? Glimepiride?”

“Cholecalciferol?”

The men lined the edge of the pavement, their wares spread out in front of them in neat rows. Most stood or sat cross-legged; others had thought to bring a stool and a folding table, giving them a more dignified, businesslike look. They called out the names to anyone in earshot, the syllables jangled and uncorrelated like demented birdsong.

“Hello, miss. Bevacizumab? Paclitaxel? Miss?”

“Hello?”

Malaf kept her head down, acknowledging nobody. Their diction was impressive, she had to give them that. They were selling foreign medicines smuggled over the border, usually with little thought given to proper storage or refrigeration. Half their customers were doctors from the nearby hospital, people whom Malaf hoped had a handle on how much leeway there really was in medical expiration dates. The street market was highly illegal, but it was also the only way some drugs could get past the sanctions, so as long as the dealers restricted themselves to *these* products, and *these* streets, the police turned a blind eye.

Malaf glanced at the map on her mobile, then up at the office building in front of her. From her research online she knew that RaamCo Construction Finance occupied the fourth, fifth and sixth floors of the building.

This was where Lineh worked.

Which, problematically, also made it where Maara worked. The last thing Malaf wanted was for Maara to catch her snooping around, especially after their discussion at Café Kesh. It could get awkward. That said, Malaf’s questions had already led to her being arrested and threatened with jail time. What was a little awkwardness compared to that?

Cheering herself with such thoughts, she entered the building.

---

\noindent “I’m here for Lineh Parkiesh.”

The receptionist blinked at her. He was young and looked not too bright. Doubtless somebody’s son or nephew crowbarred into a job where he couldn’t do too much harm. “She’s not in today.”

“Oh come *on.*” Malaf dumped onto the receptionist’s desk a thick slab of printed paper bound in clear plastic. “I came all that way to deliver this, and she’s not even here?”

“Sorry,” the receptionist said. “I can take it for her.”

He reached for the document, but Malaf snatched it away. “Not so fast, cowboy,” she told him. She turned it to show its front cover. URGENT. CONFIDENTIAL. FOR L PARKIESH ONLY. “I can’t leave it with anyone except her. She told me on the phone she’d be *here* today.”

“She’s off sick.”

“Since when?”

“She’s been off all week.”

“Yikes. That bad, huh? What’s wrong with her?”

“They didn’t tell me.”

“Well, I hope it’s nothing too serious.” *They,* Malaf thought. *When you could have said ‘she’.* “Look, I’ve come all the way from Ez Takhab to give this to her in person. Do you think she’ll be at home?”

The boy regarded her cautiously. “I can’t tell you where she lives.”

“She won’t mind,” Malaf said, reassuringly. She skipped the detail that she already *knew* where Lineh lived. “But if you want to be sure, why don’t you call her? This is an important document I’ve translated for her. She’s been waiting for it for God knows how long. Once she hears I’m in town, she’ll give you the okay to tell me her address – or tell me herself.”

“Why haven’t you called her?”

“I only have her work e-mail.” Lying is fun if you’re good at it. “Come on, phone her. You’ll be doing her a favour.”

He shrugged. “Who shall I say is calling?”

She handed over a business card: Malaf Sagheedi, Translator (English and French). *And former international drug smuggler,* she thought. That part of her, so easily half-forgotten, was unignorable now that Qaseh and the others had again invaded her life.

The receptionist placed the card on the desk beside his computer, made a few clicks on the mouse to bring Lineh’s details up, then made the call.

Malaf waited, heart suddenly pounding. What if everything was actually fine? Maybe it really *was* as simple as Lineh avoiding her. If so, she would find out now...

But after a few minutes the boy hung up. “She’s not picking up,” he told her.

“Are you calling her mobile or her landline?”

He gave her a sour look.

“Maybe one of her co-workers has her mobile number?” Malaf asked, trying for her prettiest smile.

After a long pause, in which the boy clearly hoped Malaf would either leave or evaporate, he sighed, and stood up. “If you wouldn’t mind taking a seat...”

“Very kind of you,” Malaf said, and sat.

The receptionist left into the main office, which he opened with an electronic key card.

Malaf was on her feet a picosecond after the door had shut. The boy had locked the computer screen, so nothing useful was showing. Other than that, there were a few documents lying on the desk. Probably nothing more interesting than PO forms for paperclips. Still, she brought out her phone and started snapping photos.

A glance up at the door. Nothing yet.

What else? An out-of-hours sign-in book. She opened it. Neat rows of names, dates, times, each page going back a month or so. Signatures. No time to read anything: she photographed them.

Another book, this one for visitors. Name, date, time, company represented. Snap snap. Data hoarding: collect first, decide why later. It was, she realised, a Qaseh-ish thing to do.

Malaf thought of him now, his investigations, the files he kept on people. Had he had one on *her* these years? On the night of her arrest, had he had to look up Malaf’s home address online, or was it already saved on a hard disk somewhere, just in case?

She’d hoovered up everything that was on show, and still she had time. What next? Go through the drawers? Malaf wasn’t that reckless. Instead she walked around the small space of the reception, looking around. Framed photos on the walls: buildings under construction. Sometimes they showed the finished project, either a photo or a computer-rendered artist’s impression. The buildings had a complicated, industrial look to them. Factories, maybe. A mission statement, written in bad Rami and worse English, asserting the company’s passionate commitment to finding specialist financial solutions for visionary Ramestani construction projects.

“What do you do for a living?” Malaf had asked Lineh, the first time they met, in Café Kesh. She’d tried it in French but Lineh hadn’t got it; they’d long since switched to Rami.

“I have one of those bullshit jobs,” Lineh had said, airily. “You know this English word, ‘bullshit?’”

“Oh yes,” Malaf assured her. “I know bullshit.”

The door beeped open, and the receptionist pulled it open to let another man through. This new arrival was in his forties, stockily built, wearing a grey suit. In his right hand he was holding Malaf’s business card, finger and thumb on diagonally opposite corners.

“Miss Sagheedi?”

“Yes?”

“I’m Asram Tarseech, Lineh’s manager,” the man said. “Could we speak somewhere privately?”

---

\noindent Their journey took them past the entrance to an open-plan office; Malaf kept her face turned away, hoping her outfit wasn’t one Maara might recognise.

Tarseech led Malaf to a small meeting room. They sat on either side of a wooden desk, a conference call microphone sitting between them. Malaf was reminded uncomfortably of her night in the police station.

Tarseech leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, regarding her levelly. “How can I help you, Miss Sagheedi?”

“I’m trying to find someone who knows where Lineh Parkiesh is.”

“Why do you want to know?”

“She’s my client.”

Tarseech frowned. “I’m not aware of her requesting any translations–”

“No, this is a private commission by Miss Parkiesh.”

“And you have been...” Tarseeh looked at Malaf’s business card. “Translating for her?”

“Yes.”

“May I ask what?”

“Of course not.”

Tarseech nodded, apparently pleased with this answer. “You know English?”

“Yes.”

“When the sanctions lift we’ll want to expand internationally.”

Malaf rolled her eyes. “Because *that* is going to happen any day now.”

“I admit, things haven’t been looking so good lately,” Tarseech conceded, “but this can’t go on forever. And when it happens I’ll need translators, especially in English.”

“Well,” Malaf said, “you have my card, so please get in touch. I’m very good at what I do and so naturally my fees are exorbitant.”

Tarseech smiled, and carefully put her business card to one side. “You want to see Lineh?”

“Yes.”

“She hasn’t been feeling well.”

“And she isn’t answering her phone.” Malaf looked at the document she’d brought with her as a prop – actually just the warranty for her washing machine, printed twenty times for thickness – and decided to drop the act a little. “I know her well, and I’m worried about her.”

Tarseech nodded thoughtfully. “I can ask someone to go to her house this evening. Check that she’s all right. Naturally, I can’t tell *you*, but I’ll inform her of your concerns and suggest she gets in touch.”

“Thank you.”

Tarseech watched her for a long time. “How do you know Lineh?”

“She’s learning French.”

“I didn’t know that. Is she any good?”

“Hopeless, but determined to improve.”

“That sounds like her,” Tarseech said. There was a brief silence, in which Tarseech appeared to be trying to make a decision. “I spoke to her the other day,” he said eventually.

“When?” Malaf instantly regretted how quickly she’d asked, the edge of desperation in her voice.

“Monday evening,” Tarseech said. “She’d sent an email to say she was ill. That evening I gave her a call, just to see if she was all right.”

*Monday evening.* It pushed forward the last anyone had heard from her by two whole days. Malaf tried not to let her excitement show. She leaned back in her chair, regarding Tarseech levelly. “You phoned her at home?”

Tarseech hesitated, as if realising he’d made a mistake.

“Is that something you normally do when a fairly minor employee gets sick?” Malaf pressed on.

“Minor employee? Is my concern supposed to scale with salary?” Tarseech knew as well as Malaf did that that usually *was* how it worked, but Malaf was willing to play along and look contrite. “But you’re quite right. I had other reasons for checking in on Miss Parkiesh.”

“Such as?”

“We have a good working relationship,” he said, shrugging. “I wouldn’t call us friends, but she’s efficient and good at her job. Good enough that I notice when things aren’t right with her. She’s been distracted, not focused on the task at hand.”

“You wanted to tell her off?”

“I was *concerned* that something was upsetting her to the point where it was interfering with her work.” The look he gave Malaf told her his patience was running out. “I called her to make sure she was all right.”

“Did she sound ill?”

“What does someone ill sound like? She says she isn’t fit for work and I believe her.” Tarseech raised an eyebrow at Malaf. “Why should I think otherwise? Is there something *you* know, Miss Sagheedi? Hmm? Is there a clue in that translation you have there?”

Malaf smiled at him, fingers drumming on the printout in her hands as she got to her feet. “I guess that’s between me and Lineh, Mr Tarseech.”

“Yes,” Tarseech said, coldly. “I’ll be sure to tell her you came looking for her. You can show yourself out.”

---

\noindent Malaf remembered that there was a bazaar not too far away, and walked there. It was close to midday and the place was packed with shoppers, but by visiting stalls near the periphery she was able to assemble a meal without needing to elbow too many people out of the way. She bought bread, figs and cheese, and got lucky with a shaded spot on a bench. An old man on a bicycle was doing the rounds with a huge barrel of tea strapped to his back; she flagged him down and bought a cup to wash down the bread.

She took out her mobile, cupping her hand over the screen against the glare, and started going through the photographs she’d taken in the reception. Some were too blurry to read any text, but at full zoom and with a bit of squinting a few were legible.

She looked without knowing what she was looking for. The out-of-hours sign-in sheet went back a couple of months on one page, suggesting that it didn’t get much use. It could be that employees were encouraged *not* to fill it in: the Ramestani economy was built on undeclared overtime. There were no references to Lineh anywhere. Maara’s signature cropped up a couple of times.

The visitors’ book was similarly well-reproduced. Malaf looked through it carefully, reading the names of the companies RaamCo Construction Finance had done business with, recognising none – not even PetRaam, although Qaseh had mentioned that that had been a long time ago.

But one of the visitors’ names leapt out at her.

She thought back to her typed conversation with Qaseh, about the tenuous link between Lineh’s company and his own mysterious investigation. He said he regretted even mentioning it to Malaf, because it was so long ago. And yet here it was: Ros Khesri, paying a visit to the office, just two weeks ago.

Smiling to herself, Malaf opened vVhisper.

> **1.31 PM: MALAF S OPENS CONVERSATION**

## II

Eyes still watering from the coughing fit that he felt had nearly killed him, Payim straightened up, caught his breath, and squinted through tears at the billboard in the distance. It read:

\hfill \break

O~3~ — SAFE

PM~2.5~ — SAFE

PM~10~ — SAFE

NO~2~ — SAFE

SO~2~ — SAFE

CO — SAFE

\hfill \break

Payim didn’t know what those chemical symbols meant. Ressi had explained them to him once, drawing diagrams of bonds and atoms that had given him another migraine. But he knew they made you very, very sick. In recent years Ez Raam’s smog situation had become so bad that the municipality had started putting up electronic signs like this, updated minute by minute, presumably to alert the public whenever they thought it might be a good idea not to breathe for the next few hours.

The safety levels were indicated by colour: green, yellow, and presumably also red, although nobody had seen that and lived to tell about it. Right now, all the signs were green, and to some people this would have been reassuring. However, rather than just stopping there, the sign-makers had made a fatal mistake: they had shown, in bar chart format, the exact levels of each species of airborne crud people like Payim were presently inhaling.

Payim obsessed over those levels, watching them as a hayfever sufferer might watch the cycle of harvests, trying to divine the particular grain of pollen that was causing him such misery. He sought correlations between ozone levels and sneezing fits, sulfur dioxide and eczema. Thoughts like this kept him awake at night, and when they did, he blamed the PM~2.5~.

Payim rubbed the muscles in his aching back. This, he conceded, was likely not attributable to air quality, and was more probably to do with having stood there, in that exact spot, ten hours a day for close to three weeks, excepting brief intermissions for prayer and, very occasionally when Ressi said yes, food.

It was possible to find anything in Ez Raam, and usually it was fairly obvious where to look. Over hundreds of years the city’s shopping districts had evolved into a fractal structure seemingly without bottom, with each vendor on each street corner selling a slightly different subsubcategory of anything conceivable by human imagination. Within the vast district where the clothes shops could be found, one area focused on menswear. Within that, there was a place one went for formal attire, and within that, one street that everyone who was in the know knew was absolutely *the* go-to place for men’s formal hats. And walking down that street, on the side of the road that sold modern men’s formal hats, as opposed to traditional men’s formal hats, each shop had found its own little niche and dug in hard.

Ez Raam would give you anything, if you knew where to find it.

Payim and Ressi were where one went to find labour. Bodies, muscle, not necessarily brains. The place was called Hasiri Park, although there wasn’t much grass to justify the name: just cracked earth, scuffed and dusty. Payim stood among scores of other young men at the roadside, waiting for customers.

It was late in the afternoon. Like most days, all the really good jobs had come in the morning. Cars had slowed to a crawl, drawing crowds of young men competing for the work. They bragged about their skills, their strength, their lightning speed, and then dispersed when the customer picked the lucky winner. As the day had dragged on, fewer and fewer cars had come, leaving many of the men idle.

Despite the zero-sum nature of the game, attitudes here were fairly cordial, at least until the next car came by. The men would sit on what patches of green they could find playing backgammon, or kicking a football around if the day wasn’t too hot. Payim wasn’t the social type, however. He liked to be on his own, watching the road for hours on end, thinking of nothing. It was calming.

He looked over his shoulder at his brother Ressi. The younger man was sitting in the shade of a dirty pink parasol driven into the ground, barefoot, shirt unbuttoned. Ressi was lost in his own world, turning the pages of today’s newspaper. Payim didn’t know why Ressi had a newspaper. It couldn’t possibly have been for the content: everyone knew the Ramestani papers were essentially written by the government. But it gave Ressi the look he wanted. Image mattered to him.

Ressi liked to frame himself as the brains of their partnership. When he felt especially highfalutin he would refer to himself as the pair’s commercial manager. He’d had business cards printed to that effect. What the title seemed to entail was doing much less standing at the roadside than Payim; much more sitting in the shade, devising what he insisted on referring to as their corporate strategy. As if there was any strategy to be made, when work either came by or didn’t. As if they had any choice but to stand there and wait.

A commotion nearby jerked Payim to sudden alertness. A car had arrived. It must have been here only seconds, but already it was ringed with dusty figures vying for attention. Payim heard Ressi call his name, but ignored it: he was already on his way, strong arms pushing through the crowd.

As he got closer he saw why this one had caused such a fuss. The car was new, expensive, foreign. Windows tinted almost to blackness. The rear window began to open – the *rear* window, implying a driver up front, implying *money* – and Payim was able to get a look at the potential customer.

The smile froze on his face.

The person in the back seat was a woman aged north of sixty. She wore a black gown wrapped tourniquet-tight around her face. Her eyes crinkled with whatever the opposite of laughter lines were.

Her gaze locked with Payim.

Feeling suddenly shorter of breath than the pollution had made him already, Payim stepped closer. The woman beckoned him further in, until he was practically leaning through the car window.

“Don’t just stand there,” the woman said shortly. “Fetch your brother.”

Payim swallowed, nodded. He looked around. In the distance, Ressi had got to his feet, wondering what the fuss was about. Payim shouldered his way past the others and loped over towards him.

While Payim ran, another man tried his luck at the window. “Afternoon, ma’am,” he said, grinning at her. “Plumbing? Electrics? Move some things? Great prices for you, ma’am! How can I help?”

The woman shifted in her seat, leaning slightly closer as if hard of hearing – or, more likely, as if she thought that *he* might be. In a crisp, genteel voice, she told him: “You look like you just crawled out of a hole, boy. Why don’t you fuck off back into it?”

The man blinked stupidly a few times at this, but before he’d had a chance to process it he was shoved aside by Ressi and Payim.

“Hello ma’am,” Ressi said, slightly out of breath from running. “How can I help you?”

“I want you to pave my driveway for me,” the woman said.

Payim hadn’t expected anything else; nevertheless, it made him reel. He turned to look at Ressi. Ressi himself, who would normally have been so keen, looked troubled. Payim knew what his brother was thinking, because Ressi was thinking the same thing:

*Not again. Not so soon after the last one.*

But, ultimately, what choice did they have? Ressi understood that, and so did his brother. Payim swallowed back the bile, and nodded. Ressi nodded back.

“We can help you with that,” Ressi told her, quietly.

“Good,” the woman said. “Now get in. Just you.”

Ressi and Payim exchanged glances once more, then Ressi opened the door and climbed inside. The car drove off, leaving Payim standing in a crowd of slowly dispersing men.

He watched the car take his brother away until he could no longer see it, then continued to stare at nothing in particular, waiting for his return.

Some context is necessary to understand what had just happened.

Every so often, a person would come to Hasiri Park, in a car, and would ask Ressi and Payim to pave a driveway. What this meant, most of the time, was: “I would like you to pave a driveway,” and what it led to, in most cases, was the paving, by Ressi and Payim, of a driveway.

But when this woman, in this car, asked them to pave a driveway, it did not mean: “I would like you to pave a driveway.”

What it meant was: “I would like you to kill someone for me.”

---

\noindent When it came to murder, the Ramestani government was not a big hirer of freelancers. This was because, if you were the Ramestani government, *you could just kill people.*

There were various options on the menu. One very popular technique was to arrest the victim for possessing or consuming alcohol (which many people did), or committing blasphemy (which most people did), or criticising the government (which essentially everybody did). Midnight raids of homes could be arranged at short notice, and the police excelled at finding evidence, even where none existed. The next step was to wake up a judge for a one of Ramestan’s famous late-night trials. Most government departments kept a list of pet judges who could be relied upon in such circumstances.

One such judge was Justice Olaar Koobi, a man-sized rubber stamp who could walk and talk and wear judicial robes. Recently, Justice Koobi had found himself in the centre of a controversy. A pro-democracy activist, currently wanted by the Guards’ Cybercrime Division and known only as Big Q, had somehow obtained records of Justice Koobi’s sentencing records going back over a decade, and had published this information online. What the records showed was that Justice Koobi’s conviction rate in cases brought before him was close to one hundred percent. The death penalty was awarded in almost all these cases, even for lesser crimes. Typically, this was by hanging; often, within the hour. The revelations had surprised no one, but there had been a tired kind of outrage, some half-hearted protests, and as a result, the government had ceased to keep those kinds of records.

This method of disposing of one’s enemies had its advantages. It was quiet and took place within a framework that made it legal. Against this, it was expensive and complicated. The most common alternative was to put a bomb under their car and blame Mossad. This was less subtle, but sometimes sending a message was the whole point.

There was very little need for anyone connected to the government to hire people like Ressi and Payim. Which made Ressi wary of the woman he was now riding with. The very fact that the woman was talking to Ressi suggested that she was not from the government, and yet everything else about her screamed officialdom: the clothes, the car, the attitude. She spoke like someone who knew she could do no wrong, because the people she represented were right by definition.

“We have all the necessary details, so this one won’t be difficult,” the woman called Shosa said. “Even for you.”

She spoke without facing him; it pained her even to look in his direction. Being in his presence made her want a bath, made her feel in some way contaminated by the man’s poverty and fecklessness. Granted, she needed him; indeed, without him, her brother would already be in worse trouble than he already was. But the man was slime, and she’d be damned if riding in her car made him forget it.

Nor did she look through the window. Of course, there was little to no chance that their conversation could be observed through the tinted glass of her car. Even if she did get seen, it hardly mattered. *She* was nobody. *She* was the fixer, the babysitter. Someone had screwed up and now *she* had to see to it that the mess got tidied.

So she stared into middle distance, keeping the man Ressi in her peripheral vision, as if looking at him directly would dirty her eyes.

Ressi, meanwhile, was perfectly at ease. He sat as if trying the seat out, wondering whether he’d pick this model car or some other when he finally made it big.

“Is this real leather?” he asked, stroking the car’s upholstery. “It isn’t, is it? It doesn’t feel right.”

“You’re very amusing.”

“It’s the grain size,” Ressi went on, examining a patch of it closely. “Too consistent. You’ve got to check details like that before you buy. Otherwise you get taken for a sap.”

“It’s to be done tonight.” Shosa wrinkled her nose at him. “I take it you have no other engagements?”

“Nothing I can’t move around,” Ressi said. He was inspecting other features of the car, poking and picking at them with a fingernail. The switch for winding down the windows. The reading lights. The carefully soundproofed partition sealing off the car’s driver. The interior had been recently cleaned. He could smell it. He wondered if that was just for him: the removal of clues.

Just once, he wanted her to slip up. To collect him having forgotten to remove a name badge from her gown, or holding a folder marked TOP SECRET. That would be hilarious. Or to reveal, though some linguistic slip-up, some detail about whoever had hired *her* to hire *him*. But of course, finding out too much about her might cause her to take her business elsewhere, this time with Ressi’s own name on her list of obstacles to be removed.

“But still,” Ressi said, making an unhappy face, “it’s short notice. Less preparation time. That means more danger. Which means our price has gone up by... fifty percent.”

Shosa nodded. “Very well.”

*Hmm.* Ressi was disappointed: he should have asked for more. *We live and learn.* “Well, if that’s agreed, you can tell your people that my people are happy.” He gave her his broadest grin. “So, what’s the lucky man’s name?”

Shosa looked at him without expression.

“*Her* name,” she said, stiffly, “is Malaf Sagheedi.”


\vspace*{50px}

## III

Malaf had thought that there was nowhere else left for her body to ache, but the morning brought with it a fresh surprise: shooting pains in the back of her neck. These had come from sleeping with her head twisted up against the armrest of Maara’s sofa.

The sofa was one of those that could have been unfolded into a bed, but Malaf hadn’t had time for that last night. While Maara had been rooting around in a closet for spare sheets and a selection of pink and fluffy pillows, Malaf had simply curled up across the sofa and fallen asleep fully clothed. She woke with a blanket laid over her. It smelled of lavender and dust.

Malaf sat up and stretched whatever muscles she dared to. The clock on the wall said it was after nine. She was alone in the apartment. On the coffee table, a sticky note had been addressed to her.

*Gone to work. Maara. XX*

*PS: Text me.*

“No can do,” Malaf said quietly. That was a priority: she needed a phone. She had to get online and find out what had happened to the others. But that would have to wait, because unless she ate something immediately, she would die of starvation there and then.

She found the bathroom, then the kitchen. She blinked in surprise: Maara had really gone to town with the sticky notes. There were dozens of them.

*Help yourself to breakfast.*

*Bread in here. X*

*Meat, cheese. (Open new cheese!)*

*Turn on boiler before shower.*

Malaf piled up a plate of bread, cheese, jam and fruit, and ate on her feet, exploring this unfamiliar apartment. Being in Maara’s home was disconcertingly like being in her head. Her shelves were crammed with knickknacks, postcards, fridge magnets, souvenirs. Everywhere a defocused spirituality: crystals and incense sticks, tiny stone Buddhas and blue beads warding off the evil eye. Homemade paper lampshades. It would be dim in here in an evening, too dark to read by. Maara would have called that intimacy. Malaf ducked around windchimes that dangled at face-height, each one decorated with crystals that doubtless meant something to someone. She felt itchy all over just being here.

Malaf sat back down on the sofabed and took stock. She’d eaten. She was rested. And in spite of everything, she was still alive.

She wanted to lie down and cry.

*Shut up,* she told herself. *Don’t be useless. You have a job to do.*

She had to find out if anyone else had survived.

There was a small table in the hallway with a phone and a black box which Maara had helpfully labelled *WiFi*, as if Malaf didn’t know what a wireless router looked like. The password was written on the side, and a vestigial instinct flagged that as important before she remembered it was of no use to her. It was amazing how unused she had become to being without a phone.

There was a computer on a desk near the sofa bed. The dust on the keyboard suggested it didn’t get a lot of use. Malaf turned it on, and waited for what felt like hours while it downloaded and installed every software update since the invention of the mouse. And after all that waiting, all she got was a picture of some kittens and an invitation to enter a password Malaf didn’t have and which, quite surprisingly given Maara’s level of computer literacy, was something other than *password.*

Malaf grimaced. The Hollywood techno-thriller version of herself would arrive at the correct answer after a handful of inspired guesses. But what *was* the name of Maara’s first pet? The street where she grew up? Now that she came to think about it, Malaf knew almost nothing about Maara. Apart from one meal Malaf had cooked her months ago, their only conversations had been in French at Café Kesh, and all they’d talked about was fake tans and...

Holidays.

Feeling suddenly hopeful, Malaf typed *Dubai* into the password box, hit enter.

Access denied.

*Well, balls,* she thought, and started going through the desk drawers.

A minute later she gave up. No password sticky-note placed anywhere, no handwritten list of strikingly high-entropy letter/number combinations. It had been worth a try. She put everything back approximately where it had been, hoping the general disorder of Maara’s affairs would cover her tracks.

As she did so, she spotted something she’d missed. In between two stacks of letters, she found an open envelope of brown paper. Malaf reached inside and pulled out a pair of photos.

They were of Maara, outdoors, at a funfair, on a sunny day. She was eating an ice cream.

Standing next to her was Lineh.

The photos had been taken in quick succession. The first was posed, stiff: well-rehearsed slightly pouty smiles showing no teeth, hair and headscarves arranged just so. Between that photo and the taking of the second, however, their resolve had cracked. A joke had been whispered, and their studied, photogenic composure had dissolved into a giggle fit. In the second picture they were doubled over in laughter, clinging to each other for support. The camera had caught a uniquely human moment of unabashed, unguarded silliness.

When had the photo been taken? Malaf recognised a green jacket Lineh had been fond of, but shoes she hadn’t seen. Summer clothes. Had it been this year? Last year?

How much longer had she lived after that moment?

Malaf put the photos back in their envelope. Then she took them out again, and put the empty envelope back in the drawer and shut it. She hid the photos in the backpack she had salvaged from her apartment, tucking them in carefully. They would be insulated by the spare clothes, and kept flat between tightly wrapped bundles of cash.

---

\noindent Outside, Malaf found a street lined with shops and started walking. She didn’t know where she was going. It took her a while to remember what day it was. Midweek. The streets were as quiet as they ever got in Ez Raam.

She was heading for a library. They still had computers, didn’t they? She hadn’t been in one for years. Otherwise, she wanted to find an Internet café. Despite the mobile computing revolution, a few of these had managed to cling on by finding semi-legal ways of beating the filters, and offering this service to customers not quite tech-savvy enough to do it themselves. Often the government would make noises about closing down these dens of pornography and vice, but apart from occasional raids by the Guards nothing really happened.

Malaf stood at a street corner and frowned, swinging the backpack to a more comfortable shoulder. She’d been sure there would be an Internet café on every street corner; they were one of those forgettable things that one ignores enough times per day to think they were everywhere, like phone booths or public toilets. Now that it actually came to finding one – without a phone – she realised it was going to be harder than she’d thought.

There was a group of people gathered around a shop front, talking loudly, all of them peering through its front window. Malaf was wary now of crowds, but she would have to get past them anyway. Holding her backpack tightly, she came closer, and turned to see what they were looking at. Malaf tried standing on tiptoes, but she couldn’t get a good view. So she pushed closer to the front of the crowd.

It was an electronics shop. Between their heads, she could see a dozen TV screens, all tuned to the same channel. They were showing the Ramestani news. The newsreader looked grave.

There was going to be an announcement about the health of the Supreme Leader. *Oh yes,* she thought. She’d forgotten all about him.

# SIX


\vspace*{50px}


## I

After the car crash in slow motion that had been the final stages of her degree, and associated extracurricular activities in the desert, Malaf had taken a while to find her feet. Living with her father, she had applied half-heartedly for a few jobs. Maybe she would have found something if she’d tried harder, and made better use of her dad’s connections. At the very least she could have been squeezed into a secretarial job in some civil service dungeon, doing dull work for little pay and waiting for the economy to magically improve around her. She knew several people who’d hit the job market in this way, and who were still vegetating more or less where they’d been planted. No, that was not her style.

Instead, Malaf had ended up back in uni, earning a little money doing note-taking for students with disabilities. In the course of her work she’d been lent a dictaphone. Compact but heavy, the thing was likely as old as she was. It was a relic of the days when metal was cheaper than plastic, and it had none of the smooth lines or rounded corners found on its slick, modern, focus group-tested successors. She’d found it useful, grown strangely fond of it. Its disregard of ergonomics and visual appeal in the interest of raw function and sturdiness had somehow resonated with her. She had found her electronic soulmate. And so, at the end of her employment, she had contrived a means of leaving the building with the device still in her handbag.

She still had it. She had assumed it would come in handy if she ever started taking seriously her idea of becoming a translator. In fact, in the intervening years the machine had seen so little use that when Malaf tried turning it on she found that one of the batteries had leaked, smearing its insides with evil-looking NiCad foulness. Wrinkling her nose and wondering if she should maybe be wearing gloves for this, she prised the batteries out with a screwdriver, wiped up as much of the mess as she could, and inserted a fresh pair.

Malaf flicked the power switch and saw a red LED come on. She grinned with delight. *There’s my baby,* she thought.

She pressed a button and spoke into its microphone. “Cadmium poisoning. What are symptoms? Call doctor.”

She rewound, listened. As always the sound of her own voice surprised her: its primness, the accent of her family’s money. She’d felt embarrassed by it in uni, and had tried to coarsen it with slang, but that had sounded fake to her even if it fooled everyone else.

She rummaged around near where she’d kept the dictaphone. It took a little longer for her to find the audio jack that would let her plug the machine directly into her telephone. She made some quick tests to ensure the setup would work, then dialled the number she’d found online.

\noindent \[Dialling. A long pause, clicking, then a phone ringing. A crackle on the line, common with domestic calls doing long distances over outmoded lines.\]

???: Earth Sciences Department.

MS: Oh, hi. I’d like to talk with Professor Khesri, please.

???: Who shall I say is calling?

MS: My name is Malaf Sagheedi.

???: One moment please.

\[Music. Low-grade audio of classical instruments being slowly tortured. Then a click, the clearing of a throat that had tasted too much smoke.\]

RK: Hello?

MS: Professor Khesri?

RK: Speaking.

MS: Good afternoon Professor Khesri. My name is Malaf Sagheedi. I’m calling from the accounts department of RaamCo Construction Finance about a visit you made recently. How are you today, sir?

RK: What is this about?

MS: The reason I’m calling, Professor Khesri, is that it’s the end of the month and we’re finalising our accounts, and we’ve noticed some irregularities in some of our records, especially with regards to travel reimbursements for visitors.

RK: What do you mean, irregularities?

MS: Oh, nothing to worry about, sir. This is entirely a problem at our end. It would usually be dealt with by my colleague, Lineh Parkiesh. You might have met her on your visit?

RK: I... don’t recall, I’m afraid.

MS: Well, Lineh has been absent for the last few days. No idea where to; it’s very unlike her. And I’m afraid to say, with all the paperwork we’ve accumulated, we’re struggling without her. So just to make sure your travel expenses have been properly processed, I hope you won’t mind if you clarify with me some details about your trip? It won’t take more than a few minutes of your time.

RK: It will have to be very quick, I’m afraid. I’m lecturing in a few minutes.

MS: Sure thing sir, I appreciate your patience. Let me just pull up your details.

\[Sound effect: Malaf randomly pressing buttons on her switched-off laptop.\]

MS: The file is just opening now, sir. My computer’s a bit slow. What’s it about?

RK: What’s what about?

MS: The lecture you’ll be giving.

RK: What? Oh. It’s an introductory course in petroleum geology.

MS: That sounds fascinating. Maybe I should enrol in your course.

RK: You’d have to talk to our admissions department. Really, Miss Sagheedi, I’m afraid I have to—

MS: There we are, Professor, your details are up now. Ah yes, here it is: I have you down as visiting us on official business on the thirteenth of this month. Is that correct?

RK: Yes.

MS: Great. And for mileage, it says here that you came from Ez Takhab?

RK: That’s right.

MS: Was that by train, or by car?

RK: Neither: I flew.

MS: Ah yes, I’ll fix that now, sir.

\[More fake typing.\]

MS: Brilliant. And... oh, here’s the problem. You see our travel reimbursements are also supposed to factor in the purpose of the visit, and Lineh has left yours blank. What should I put?

\[Silence.\]

MS: Professor Khesri?

RK: Yes?

MS: I was just asking why you visited us that day.

RK: What did you say your name was?

MS: Malaf Sagheedi, sir.

RK: Yes, well, Miss Sagheedi, the purpose of my visit was confidential. I’m sure your managers understand.

MS: Of course, sir, but this is all in-house. It just goes on our private records.

RK: Well, you’ll just have to leave it blank.

MS: I’m afraid the spreadsheet doesn’t work like that, sir. I’ll pick a category from the drop-down, then, shall I? Shall we say ‘technical consulting’? ‘Financial advice’?

RK: This is not a conversation I’m interested in having.

MS: Really? Why so cagey, Professor?

RK: Could you please put me in touch with your manager?

MS: No, sir, I can’t do that.

RK: Why not?

MS: Because I don’t actually work at RaamCo at all. To be honest with you, I’m amazed I pulled this off for so long.

RK: But... who are you?

MS: I told you my name, sir. I’m in the phonebook, but I’m aware it’s a common name. Translator, Ez Raam, English and French: that should help. You can drop in on me any time, but I’m afraid I don’t pay travel expenses.

RK: I’m hanging up. This is outrageous.

MS: Just before you do, sir, I don’t suppose you know anything about a lady named Lineh Parkiesh? She’s disappeared, and I’m trying to find out what happened to her.

RK: *Who?* No, I don’t know anything about that, and I’m not interested in talking any further.

MS: Professor Khesri, I can’t help feeling you’re upset with me.

\[Exasperated sound. RK hangs up.\]

\noindent “I think that went very well,” Malaf told the dictaphone.

She made herself a glass of tea, then walked to her small sofa and sat down, pulling her bare feet up beneath her. Cradling the warm cup in her hands she stared at the blank walls of her apartment, thinking.

The call had been fun, but not particularly informative. There could be any number of reasons why Khesri wouldn’t want to disclose his reasons for visiting RaamCo, even to one of its own employees. And even if he was hiding some gigantic, terrible secret, well, this was Ramestan. Who wasn’t?

Did Khesri know who Lineh was? It was hard to tell, but Malaf’s gut feeling was no. It had been worth a try, though.

In sum, all she’d achieved was to lie to a complete stranger, then admit to having done so, then supply him with enough information to be able to find her and possibly call the cops on her. Put like that, it didn’t feel like a wise thing to have done. But creeping around hadn’t got her any closer to knowing what had happened to Lineh. It was time to start making some noise.

Her mobile beeped at her. It was Qaseh on vVhisper.

## II


They had left the highway long ago, climbing out of the salt flats and into the mountains to the south. The suddenness of the ascent had made their ears pop, and now the plain unfolded beneath them like the pull-out map in a fantasy novel, the low sun making every stunted tree cast long black shadows, the horizon lost in a haze of distance. For a long time the view was breathtaking. Then they reached the last bend in the zigzag road, turned a corner, and let the rocky moonscape eat them alive.

Militarily, the highlands constituted a magnificent natural barrier against invasion – or would have done, had they been slightly further west. Unfortunately, Ramestan’s traditional border, as negotiated long ago by diplomats who either couldn’t read a map or else had been thinking of something else at the time, tracked the mountain range but did not coincide with it. This left a long, sweeping crescent of land on the ‘wrong’ side of the mountains that Ramestan claimed as its own. Anyone reviewing the situation objectively would have looked at a relief map, assessed the neighbouring countries’ abilities to project military might, and simply handed the region over to the other side, gratis, with an apology for the mix-up. Indeed, the other side had tried to make that correction on Ramestan’s behalf, several times, over the past century. The most recent attempt had given martyrs’ names to half the streets in Ez Raam.

Malaf stretched out in the passenger seat, luxuriating in the extra space. Moving from Irooj’s car to Qaseh’s, she had assumed that she’d be sitting in the back. She was, as she herself insisted, an add-on the group, along for the ride without fully supporting the cause. She was also the shortest person in the car and needed the least legroom. She didn’t complain, however, when she’d ended up riding shotgun, presumably through some alchemy of being the only woman on board. Abeej and Boraz were sharing the back seat with various other bits of kit that hadn’t been able to fit in the trunk since their last stop, at which they’d bought several tanks of drinking water. Abeej was staring out of the window. Boraz, used to night shifts in his taxi, was fast asleep.

Qaseh was driving. He had tried engaging Malaf in conversation, but since leaving the diner she hadn’t been in the mood for small talk. She had stepped out of the prayer room, eyes dry but red, and walked right into the others. They had noted her condition but said nothing, letting all concerned pretend nothing was amiss.

Instead of talking, Malaf was doing her homework.

The folder was sitting open on her lap, loose paper sliding around inside with each bump over a pothole. She handled the documents carefully even though she knew they were only photocopies. Qaseh said the original material was stored in a safe place to which only he had access. He was vague on the details, in that infuriating, better-you-don’t-know way of his.

Malaf said to Qaseh: “Remind me how you got this.”

“Secure message for Big Q,” Qaseh explained. “We swapped a few emails. He said he’d heard about our organisation after we published the Justice Koobi stats, then came looking for us.”

“That didn’t strike you as suspicious?” Malaf asked. “The Koobi leak wasn’t widely reported.”

“Not in the *media.*” Qaseh spat the word. “But we planted the story widely enough online for word to get around. *You* heard about it, didn’t you?”

Malaf conceded the point.

“The man gave his name as Mr Obid. He said he was an employee of PetRaam, and that he was in possession of secret company documents that would be of interest to us.”

Malaf nodded, her eyes lingering on the PetRaam logo in the top right corner of most items in the folder. PetRaam was Ramestan’s giant state-owned oil and gas company, one of the biggest employers in the country. “So you did a search for men named Obid working for PetRaam?”

“Well, employee records are confidential, obviously.”

“How sad.”

“Not as sad as PetRaam’s going to be when they realise that whoever they hired to design their HR department’s website didn’t know much about SQL injection attacks.”

“And?”

“We managed to pull their entire employee roster. Quite a coup. But bad news: there are hundreds of Obids.”

Malaf wasn’t surprised. It was a common enough surname, nearly as common as Sagheedi. “Did he give anything else away?”

“Nothing. He was pretty careful. All we have is a surname, which may not even be his real one – and the fact that he’s local.”

“In Ez Raam? How do you know that?”

“Because when we gave him the location of an Ez Raami drop-off point, two hours later he wrote back to say he’d done it.”

Malaf nodded, lips pursed. Yes, because running a network of dead drops scattered around the city was an entirely normal thing to do, if you were someone like Qaseh. She thought back to their student days. Other boys got girls flowers, but for Qaseh, the way you knew he *really* liked you was when he gave you a sealed envelope containing a few sheets of paper printed with random numbers: your own personal one-time pad, hand-generated especially for you, for whenever you found yourself in a jam and needed to send him a message written in truly unbreakable code.

He’d given one to Malaf once. She’d thrown it away years ago.

“No communication with him since then?”

“None,” Qaseh told her. “Which is a pain. If he’d stuck around a bit longer he might have explained this stuff to us.”

“Yes,” Malaf agreed, “I can see that would have helped.”

If the documents’ implications were truly as earth-shaking as Qaseh claimed, they hid it well. The majority were just columns of figures, presented in a format that struck Malaf as odd until she realised they were printouts of parts of a much larger spreadsheet. The numbers were clearly sums of money.

There were a few fragments of text, mostly scanned printouts of emails between people whose names had been blacked out. None was longer than a few sentences, and may as well have been in code: their references to project numbers or work package allocation digests must have been clear to the recipients, but were opaque to Malaf. The dates made them about three years old.

One was a map. A place name leapt out at her.

“Ez Nezeshti,” she said out loud.

“Uh-huh,” Qaseh said, grinning through the windscreen.

“That’s odd,” Malaf said. “I see the name, but the town itself isn’t marked anywhere.”

“That’s because Ez Nezeshti is also the name of the area used on some geological survey maps,” Qaseh explained. “Ez Nezeshti the *town* was small, but it was still the biggest settlement on our side of the border. So even after the place had the shit bombed out of it so hard they stopped labelling it as a place people lived, the name for the region stuck.”

Malaf nodded slowly. Then a thought struck her. “Wait a minute. Am I getting something wrong here, or have you done something *truly* moronic?”

Qaseh considered this. “I don’t know. How recently moronic?”

“Mr Obid finds some documents about a place called Ez Nezeshti. He wants to leak them. He picks you, knowing *you’d* be interested. How in God’s name did Mr Obid make the connection between *you* and Ez Nezeshti?”

Qaseh was chuckling. Malaf stared at him, feeling suddenly ill.

“Dear God. Qaseh, I swear: if you tell me Big Q has *smuggler, Ez Nezeshti region* written on his fucking CV online, I will murder you here and now.”

“Will you please relax?” Qaseh told her, laughing. “I do have *some* common sense.”

“Imagine my relief. So what, it’s a coincidence? You seriously believe that?”

“It *is* a coincidence,” Qaseh said. Malaf snorted with disbelief, but he talked over it. “But it’s not *much* of a coincidence. Look at the rest of the file, will you? See the other maps?”

Malaf had seen them. There were six in total. The map of the Ez Nezeshti region was the only one she recognised.

“Six maps,” Qaseh went on. “All of areas competing for the title of ass-end of nowhere. One in the south of the country, fourteen hours’ drive from Ez Raam. Three so deep in desert they make this place look like rainforest in comparison. One in Ramestan’s unfashionable east end, where a cool cat like me wouldn’t be seen dead. And, yes, one of the maps is of a very large territory that happens to be *near* our favourite smuggling spot.” He shrugged. “You’ve got it the wrong way round, Malaf. Mr Obid gave us a shortlist of places to look at, including Ez Nezeshti. *We* picked it, not him.”

“Why?”

Qaseh turned to face her briefly, his face wearing an expression of mild surprise.

“Well, fond memories,” he told her. “Obviously.”

---

\noindent There was nowhere to park on Raga Siyanesh (Martyr) Street, but Ressi and Payim had learned that impossible things could be done with the correct application of traffic cones, fluorescent yellow jackets, and clipboards. The van blocked a lane of traffic, but looked official enough for nobody to care. They had plenty of ready cash in case a cop came by fishing for a bribe, and they both knew enough construction lingo to convince anyone who lacked a PhD in civil engineering that their presence here was all that was keeping Ez Raam’s entire electricity, telephone, transportation and sewerage infrastructures from bursting simultaneously into flames.

Ressi, the talker, had been the first to check if the Sagheedi woman was in. Payim watched nervously from the driver’s seat of the van as his brother crossed the road to her building and rang the buzzer a few times. Ressi waited, then shook his head: nobody home.

When he got back to the van Payim turned to face him.

“What if she doesn’t show up?” Payim asked.

“Have a little patience, will you?” Ressi had brought a newspaper with him. He opened it at the finance section and started reading. “She could come back any time, so keep an eye on the door, right?”

Payim gave him a sour look, but didn’t really mind. Sitting there waiting for things to happen was something he did well. It was peaceful. And yet this time his mind wouldn’t be still. “I don’t like it,” he said, after only a few moments.

Ressi grunted. “What particular aspect of today’s adventure displeases you, brother?”

“It’s too fast,” Payim said. “Everything. You should have asked the old woman for more time.”

“She said this one was urgent,” Ressi told him, sighing. “I told you that. You’ve got to keep the customers happy if you want to retain their business.”

“You should have asked,” Payim said again. “Especially after last time.”

*Last time.* Payim thought that one had been particularly bad, even though it had been Ressi who’d actually done the deed. Payim had been nearby, supposedly on the lookout for witnesses, but he’d been unable to take his eyes off the whirlwind of violence his brother had unleashed. The sight of it had made Payim want to puke.

And the next morning, they had tiled someone’s bathroom. Payim didn’t know how Ressi could do it: switching so easily between the murderous and the mundane.

It occurred to him, there in the van, that maybe for Ressi the difference wasn’t so huge. They were both jobs to do, both involving a lot of heavy lifting and cleaning up afterwards. Ressi thought of both in purely physical terms: objects in space, to move around, to tie down, to cut into shape.

Maybe, for Ressi, killing people was a bit of a bore.

“Do you think she’s at work?” Payim asked.

Ressi shook his head without looking up. “She works from home.”

“How do you know that?”

“An invention called ‘the Internet’. You might not have heard of it, but it’ll be big news some day. She’s a translator, freelance.”

Ressi always looked up the names he was given, both before the deed as part of the planning stage, but also afterwards, when any sensible person in his position would be trying hard to forget. One day he’d find something, some clue in the choice of victim, that would point to the people who hired him. And that knowledge, used correctly and at the right time, would be power. Until then...

“If she’s out, she must be meeting a client,” he went on. “She’ll be back home soon. Self-employed: time is money. You know?”

He went back to his paper.

\noindent The sun-bleached broken buildings were casting long shadows across the barren ground by the time Qaseh’s car entered Ez Nezeshti.

For centuries, the town had served as a stop on a major trading route into and out of Ramestan. It had built itself up on both sides of a bend in a river, and stretched out along the valley, longer than it was wide. The river posed a problem for moving an invading army’s materiel, which made the capture of the town’s three stone bridges an essential part of any grand strategy.

During the more energetic parts of the war – which had been unpleasant even by the standards set by wars – Ez Nezeshti had passed from invader- to defender-held and back several times. It had earned fresh scars each time. Shelling had left most buildings uninhabitable. Some had quickly become barely recognisable *as* buildings. All of this the town might have survived. But then came the gas: chlorine, phosgene oxime, sulfur and nitrogen mustards.

“Gas? I wouldn’t worry about the gas,” Qaseh had told them, on their first ever smuggling run. He’d spoken at length about residence times, half-lives and toxicity thresholds. He did it with such understated confidence that it was easy to forget he knew precisely jack shit about it. Still, Malaf thought, they had visited six times before and not fallen, and that was years ago. However poisonous the place had been back then, it could only be safer now.

The main road into town was potholed and strewn with rubble. Qaseh slowed his car to a walking pace.

“If you do *insist* on worrying,” Qaseh had said, “I’d worry about unexploded land mines.”

Malaf stared out of the window, fascinated, as she had been every time, with this devastated snapshot of another time. Billboards advertised brands she hadn’t thought about since childhood. The banana flavoured sweets she used to like. A TV show that hadn’t run in years. It would have been nostalgic if the signs hadn’t been scarred with bullet holes.

“Think anyone has been here since our last trip?” asked Boraz from the back of the car.

“Probably,” Qaseh said. “Disaster tourists. Take a selfie in a bombed-out office.”

“It’s a long way to come, isn’t it?” Abeej asked.

“Not from the other side of the border,” Malaf replied. “The nearest town’s not too far away. That’s probably where our old smuggler friends lived.”

“Crossing the border is still totally illegal, of course,” Qaseh said, “but hey, we’re all criminals now, right?”

“We could go into business,” Boraz suggested. “Bus people over from Ez Raam. Give them a guided tour, packed lunches. Souvenir gas masks.”

“Nah, tourists would only cheapen it,” Abeej retorted. “Ruin this unspoiled site.”

“Ruin the ruins.”

“I wonder how far back Irooj and Tusham are,” Malaf said. They had lost the Pasham Sixty going up a hill a while ago. Qaseh’s car had easily outpaced it up that gradient and they hadn’t seen it since. Malaf wondered if she ought to call them. Then she remembered that she’d lost her phone, and it wouldn’t have had signal anyway. “Didn’t we bring radios?” she asked.

“Yep,” Abeej said. “They’re in the back, with the binoculars.”

“They.”

“Yes.”

“As in *both* handsets? *In the same car?*”

“Yes.”

Malaf raised an eyebrow at him.

“I concede this was not my smartest move,” Abeej said.

“It’s okay. Give me one of them and let me out here. You can tell me how it all goes.”

“Comrades, if I might interrupt your discussion...” said Qaseh, in that uncomfortable tone of voice he adopted whenever he was forced to concede he didn’t know something. “Which way am I going?”

Malaf and the others tried to remember. Ez Nezeshti wasn’t a huge town, but its layout made it easy to get lost. Near the old town centre the streets were especially winding and chaotic. The real problem, though, was the damage that had been done to the buildings. One collapsed house looked very much like another, and every wall still standing had been blasted a dull, uniform grey.

Between the four of them they managed to reconstruct their old route through the ruins. Left at the cracked dome of the mosque. Straight on past the burned-down cinema. Bypassing a road closed off with sandbags.

“I’ll take us to the old football pitch,” Qaseh said. “Unless there are any objections?”

The others shook their heads. On their earlier visits they had picked this spot for their campsite because it was clear of rubble, and far from any building that might collapse on them. They saw no reason to change.

Qaseh finally brought the car to a stop in the football pitch’s car park. He turned off the engine. “Home sweet home,” he said, giving Malaf a grin she couldn’t help at least partially returning.

The air outside the air-conditioned car was hot even in the evening. Malaf’s headscarf had been hanging vaguely around her neck since changing cars. Now she pulled it off entirely, stuffed it into a trouser pocket.

They were silent for a while. The desolation of this place, and the memories it brought back, cast a spell over them that nobody wanted to be the first to break. They drifted apart, each finding their own space and direction to look, as if by turning their backs on one another they could imagine themselves even more cut off from the world.

The engine ticked as it cooled. Somewhere an insect buzzed. Those were the only sounds until Qaseh opened the boot of the car. He rummaged around among the tightly packed items until he found the vodka: they’d transferred over one of the bottles at the diner. He poured a generous slug into a plastic cup for each of them, then proposed a toast.

“To places, and people, who have seen better days.”

In the heat, the alcohol rose up to sting Malaf’s nose, like ether.

---

\noindent Tusham and Irooj arrived thirty minutes later. The Sixty’s engine whinnied down into silence, giving such an impression of relief that Malaf wondered if the poor thing could make it all the way back to Ez Raam.

Irooj, who’d driven the whole way, took a swig of vodka straight from the bottle. The strength of it made her eyes water. “Wow, Qaseh,” she spluttered. “Changed your recipe?”

“The trick is to use only the happiest potatoes.”

“No wonder this is illegal,” she said, filling a cup for Tusham. “If I knew how it was going to taste I’d have turned you in at the nearest Guard station.”

Tusham took the cup in his big hands and sipped in a way that was almost dainty. “We should have got in touch with our friends across the border,” he mused. “See if they could bring us some of the real thing.”

“Yes,” Abeej said, an unpleasant look on his face. “Because they turned out to be so honest and reliable.”

“They must have gone out of business years ago,” Boraz added.

“Or been caught and executed,” Malaf said, flatly.

This killed the mood somewhat. After an awkward pause, Abeej pointed out that it would be dark soon, and they’d better start unpacking.

Before long they had the camping gear out of the cars. Three two-person tents went up side by side. “There!” Boraz said, securing the last of the ropes. “Three tents, and... six of us.”

He hesitated, doing the maths. Two people per tent. Irooj and Tusham were a couple. So which of the boys would be sharing with Malaf?

She and Qaseh studiously avoided eye contact.

There followed an uncomfortable moment as permutations were mentally sorted through. Eventually Irooj broke the stalemate, stepping away from her husband to slip her arm through Malaf’s. “Hey cutie. You doing anything tonight?”

Malaf snorted, feeling herself redden without knowing quite why. She gave the arm a squeeze. “I’m all yours, girlfriend.”

---

\noindent It was warm enough and light enough from moonlight for them not to need a fire, but they lit one anyway: something to sit around, drink around. They cooked on a tiny butane stove and drained the first bottle of vodka. Qaseh tossed it onto the fire. “Maybe the glass’ll melt,” he said to no one in particular.

The wood for the fire had come from wooden chairs raided from a nearby school. The school had been used at some point as a combat hospital: classrooms full of mattresses, bright yellow sharps bins, walls still decorated with multiplication tables; all watched over by a photo of the Supreme Leader, bleached by years of sunlight from the broken roof.

“Do you reckon he’s still alive?” Boraz asked.

The question had come out of nowhere, but nobody needed to ask who he meant.

“It’d be a funny thing,” Irooj said. “Coming home and finding him gone.”

“We’d miss the party,” Abeej joked.

There were a few laughs, but they were uncertain laughs. The fact was that nobody knew what would happen if the Supreme Leader actually did die.

On paper, of course, the rules of succession were clear. In accordance with the Constitution and the will of God, the senior clerics would convene, pray, and elect the one man best able to defend the faith from the twin enemies of imperialism and individualism. Naturally for a decision that was divinely inspired, the result would be unanimous. Indeed, the last election had been advertised as a tremendous show of spiritual unity. But even as the announcement was being made, rumours of infighting were spreading like cholera. Stories emerged of hidden deals, secret arrests, threats against families. These old men were well used to violence being carried out on their behalf, and many of them commanded the loyalties of huge factions within the army and Guard. If power had been transferred bloodlessly last time, it could only have been because of a unique set of circumstances that were not guaranteed to be repeated.

“It’ll be a shitstorm whatever happens,” Tusham said darkly, and nobody could disagree.

“Doubtless the vultures are circling,” Qaseh said. “Politicians as well as clergy. And with a Presidential election coming up, too...”

“Oh, God,” Irooj moaned. “Is it that time *again?*”

“Any thoughts on that, Malaf?” Abeej asked. “With your insider knowledge?”

Malaf squirmed slightly, as she did whenever this came up. “Dad and I don’t talk about politics. As a fairly basic survival strategy. Not to mention he’s so deep in paperwork he can hardly see out of the window. He could be sitting in the middle of a coup d’etat and he wouldn’t notice.”

“But you must get some hints,” Boraz insisted. “From all those functionary dinners when he hangs out with, I don’t know, Ebri Hoz and his friends?”

“I think you’re overestimating Dad’s degree of influence and access,” Malaf said, tiredly. “In the great org chart of government, he doesn’t even merit his own box.”

She knew the others knew this. It just amused them to point out her background from time to time, hinting at a vast, unbridgeable class divide between them. It was tiresome, now as ever before.

“Well,” Qaseh said. “I hope the old boy lives.”

“Really?” Irooj asked.

“Absolutely.” Qaseh said, grimly. He jerked a few strands of dead grass from the ground and began rolling them into a ball between finger and thumb. “If he dies now it would be the worst timing for us.”

“Afraid of your story getting bumped to page two?” Abeej asked.

“Of course I am!” Qaseh’s tone was sharper than he’d meant it to be. He grinned self-deprecatingly, but his anxiety was clear. “What we’ve uncovered is big news. Played well, it could be huge. But when El Supremo finally snuffs it, the whole country is going to be plunged into chaos anyway. Everything will be set at zero and started again. Our story won’t just get lost in the noise: it will no longer *matter.* Old sins will be forgotten. They’ll belong to a past age. If we’re going to change anything, it has to be while the main players are still around to suffer the consequences.”

They all watched him in silence. Watched the firelight flicker on his face.

“It’s not enough to break the story. We need it to *hurt* someone. Badly. Publicly. If heads roll because we show people the truth, it’ll remind people that the truth matters. That it’s worth fighting for. *That* is the story behind the story. *That* is why we’re here.”

He flicked the little knot of dried grass into the flames.

“First, we publish,” he finally said. “Then he’s allowed to die.”

He looked up at the expressions on the others’ faces, and grinned.

“Yes, I *am* available as a motivational speaker,” he said. “Mondays to Fridays only. My rates are very reasonable.”

“Do you charge by the word?” Malaf asked.

He winked at her. “Per revolution incited, my dear.”

---

\noindent It was past midnight when Ressi and Payim made their move. They exited the van wearing dark blue overalls and hard hats, each carrying a heavy toolbox.

The concierge’s booth was empty. They kept their heads down as they walked past the security camera – a needless precaution, since the thing was broken anyway. There was a set of stairs, which they climbed up to the third floor. Their destination was the fourth apartment along. The old woman had told them where to go.

Ressi took the lead, as he usually did. He set his toolbox on the floor, then silently opened it to remove a sturdy hammer. Payim had seen – would never be able to unsee – the damage it could do to a person’s head. Payim too put down his toolbox. Out of it, he produced a gun, as a backup.

Ressi inclined his head just so. *Ready?*

Payim swallowed, nodded.

Ressi knocked gently on the door. “Miss Sagheedi?” he called.

There was no reply. Payim hadn’t expected one: they’d been watching her door for hours and hadn’t seen her. His grip on the gun was knuckle-crackingly tight, his hand sweaty. There was something in the air here that made him want to cough. He fought that down, feeling his eyes water.

“Miss Sagheedi?” Ressi asked, knocking more loudly.

They gave it a minute longer. Then Ressi shrugged, and bent over the toolbox.

For the first time Payim raised the gun. He sighted along it, aiming for where the woman’s head would appear if the door suddenly swung open. He imagined her expression turning from puzzlement to horror as she saw him. If he did have to shoot, he wanted it to be before she had a chance to scream.

Ressi brought out an electric drill. He shot a querying look at Payim, who felt a sting of shame. The look alluded to the time when Payim had forgotten to charge the battery for a job. It hadn’t mattered in the end, but Ressi had given him an earful nonetheless. It had been one of those sudden, explosive bursts of fury of which Ressi was so capable. Coming out of nowhere, these paroxysms of rage were astonishing both for their violence and for how rapidly they subsided. Ressi could do terrible things when calm, as Payim knew well enough; but when he was truly angry, for those few seconds, the world shook.

Ressi tried knocking one more time. “Miss Sagheedi? It’s urgent, please.”

Nothing.

Ressi nodded, and brought the drill up to the door’s lock. There was a scream of grinding metal. Payim checked the corridor for movement. The noise would have woken everyone in the building. They had to act quickly.

The drilling took an agonisingly long time. After that, opening the door was easy. Ressi stepped aside, and nodded to Payim, who stepped over the threshold, gun ready.

Ressi waited a few moments while Payim swept the apartment. He listened, hearing nothing. “Coming in now, brother,” he announced. Safety first: he didn’t want to startle Payim and end up with his brains blown out.

He found Payim standing in the middle of the apartment’s living room.

“No one home,” Payim explained, trying to keep the relief out of his voice.

There was a noise from below: a neighbour thumping on the ceiling with a broom or something. Ressi stomped back, screaming, “*You shut the hell up or I’ll shut you up for you!*” Payim cringed; but the thumping stopped.

Ressi took a deep breath, calming himself. Then he beamed at Payim. “Be a gentleman and close the door, would you?”

Ressi had a phone number written on a scrap of paper, to be called only if something went wrong. The number was different each time: presumably, on successful completion of a job, the phones were thrown away, unused. Details like that impressed him. He’d never had to call before. With a little sigh at having to break the streak, he tapped the number into his own phone – a cheap burner which, he realised, he too would have to destroy now.

The other side picked up on the first ring, but said nothing, just listened.

“Ez Raam Upholsterers,” Ressi said brightly after a pause. “I hear you’re in the market for some real leather car seats?”

“Get on with it.” Shosa’s voice was tense, breathless.

“She’s not come home.”

“You are certain?”

“We’re in her apartment now. It’s empty.” Ressi looked around, pacing slowly into her bedroom. “I think she’s gone on a trip.”

“What makes you say that?”

“On her bed there are clothes, folded but not neatly,” Ressi said.

Not all folded, he noted: there was rather a nice dress lying on the floor. Purple and green. Ressi picked it up and ran its fabric between finger and thumb. It felt gorgeous. Expensive. He could feel the smoothness of sizing on it, which meant it was new, worn maybe just once. Interesting.

“It looks like she was packing a bag in a hurry, and these didn’t make the cut. Underwear drawer left open.” He peered inside, letting his gaze linger there. All rather plain. No exciting textures for a finger to probe. Nearby he spotted the jewellery box, lying shut on the bedside cabinet. “Also,” he said, wondering how much he could sell its contents for, “her jewellery has all gone.”

“I’m sure it has,” Shosa said drily. “Any idea where she’s gone?”

Ressi opened the jewellery box, held up one of Malaf’s rings for inspection. “Hard to say,” he told her. It was probably worthless, but he pocketed it anyway.

He was aware of Payim standing beside him, flapping an arm to get his attention. Ressi ignored him at first, then saw what he was pointing to.

“Well, actually...”

“Talk.”

Ressi hesitated. He noticed Payim gawping at him when he ought to have been watching the door like he’d been told. Ressi made a shoving gesture, and Payim took the hint. Then he lowered his voice to speak quietly into the phone, his voice sounding uncertain – an unusual thing for him. It didn’t come naturally. “Look, I don’t like to send people on a wild goose chase, because this just seems too contrived for words.”

“Your concern is touching. What are you talking about?”

“Well... it’s just, there’s a map on the wall.” Ressi looked at it closely, frowning as if he couldn’t believe it. “A map of Ramestan. Just sort of hung there, like a decoration.”

“A map?”

“Yeah. And... I’m not joking, but she’s drawn an arrow on it.”

“An arrow?”

“Yeah. Crazy, right?” He ran a finger across it, feeling the tiny crease where the pen had pushed the paper. “And a name written on it. A place name.” He gave a nervous little laugh. “Look, I wouldn’t read too much into this, all right? I mean, it’s like she’s left us an envelope with the word ‘CLUE’ written on it. It could mean anything or nothing.”

“What is the place name?”

*I shouldn’t even have mentioned this,* Ressi thought. “It says: Ez Nezeshti.”

There was a brief silence on the line.

“You still there?” Ressi asked.

“Yes,” Shosa said. Her voice was strange now. Hollow. Drained of emotion. “Wait a moment, please.”

And, obedient soul that he was, he waited. He watched his brother. Payim was pacing up and down, clearly aware that every second they spent here was dangerous for them. Ressi, in contrast, felt quite at ease in this stranger’s home. He sat on her bed, bouncing slightly to test the quality of its springs. Not bad, he decided. And the sheets were good quality, too. He ran a free hand over the pillow the Sagheedi woman’s head had rested on, stroked it idly. He found one of her hairs lying on the fabric, picked it up and examined it as best as he could in the low light.

On the other end of the line, he heard talking, muffled. The woman had her thumb over the microphone or something. Intrigued, Ressi turned up the volume on his own phone. He listened carefully. *There* was the woman’s voice. And... yes, it was a man she was speaking with.

“*I can’t believe you did a–*”

The shout startled Ressi. Whatever the woman had said, the man standing in the room with her was screaming at her. He tried to make out the words but they were indistinct. *Can’t you see*, he thought he heard. *Without telling me.* *Stupid bitch.*

Then the woman was screaming back with a ferocity that surprised him. *Useless,*
she said once. *Ungrateful bastard.* *Everything myself.*

To which the man responded with yet more screaming, and then a long bout of what sounded like both of them yelling at once. Ressi felt oddly embarrassed to be a witness to this. It was like hearing his parents fighting.

There was a scuffling sound. One person snatching the phone out of the other’s hand. A slow intake of breath. An attempt at calm.

“So?”

It was the man’s voice. At last Ressi was speaking with the person who had *really* hired him. He wanted to say something funny, but in the weirdness of the situation his wits had deserted him. The best he could do was, “So what?”

A pause while the man got his anger back under control.

“Okay,” he finally said. “Confirm that you are in the Sagheedi woman’s house?”

“Affirmative.”

“You forced the door in some way?”

“Hard to get inside otherwise.”

“*You were–*” Fury again. A deep breath. The man tried again, his voice under iron control. “I was *under the impression*...” Ressi imagined a pointed glance at the old woman. “...that you were to wait outside until you saw Sagheedi and move then.”

“What can I say?” Ressi replied jovially. “These things happen.”

“Do they, now? The sheer incompetence...”

Ressi was about to tell the man not to be so hard on himself, but decided against it. Meanwhile, something was bothering him. Didn’t this man’s voice sound familiar?

“We’ll deal with how this blunder affects *you* later,” the man said. “Right now, my main concern is what it does to *me.* She’ll know you broke in. That forces my hand somewhat. You’ll need to act quickly. And no more screw-ups, you understand?”

*Ah.* Ressi hadn’t been sure before, but he was now. He *had* heard the voice before. Everybody had.

Ressi had wanted to know who was hiring him. Well, now he knew. And he almost wished he didn’t.

“All right. Let’s talk about this map.”

Ressi swallowed. “Okay.”

“And about... Ez Nezeshti.”

“Okay.”

## III

Once, a long time ago, Imam Raz Boraqashti had killed a man – a boy, in fact, probably no more than seventeen years old.

It had been done in the courtyard of Ez Raam’s Central Prison, in the smoggy flat light of summer. Executions were usually carried out at night, while the others were sleeping, and by hanging, which was quieter. But this was war, and at such times one had to be flexible.

Boraqashti had stalked into the prison, his bodyguards taking positions defending him front and back. The warden was furious at the intrusion, demanding an explanation. Boraqashti didn’t offer one, didn’t meet the warden’s gaze; but a look from one of the bodyguards had quickly silenced him.

In his characteristic, barely audible mumble, the holy man had asked for the names of the men in D-block due to be released that day, and a gun.

D-block: a minimum security section for non-violent criminals. Its original purpose had been as a holding area for inmates waiting to be sent elsewhere. Recently, however, its population had exploded, filled beyond capacity with men imprisoned for their opposition to the war and, by implication, the regime itself. The overcrowding had been bad, but manageable. Then came the tipping point: the mass arrests of sit-down protesters, mostly students, in the Technical University. The situation became unsustainable, and the ruling powers were faced with a simple choice: either find another place to hold them, or let them go.

Nobody who knew Boraqashti had been surprised when he proposed a third option.

*And still they hesitated!* Certainly, there were nods of agreement in Parliament: subtle, tentative, always looking for other people’s reactions before showing their support. But it was an agreement in principle only. There would have to be discussions. There would be *committees.* Dear God, how people dithered! Even when the path ahead was demonstrably clear, as inevitable as a forced move in chess. On days of fat and honey these politicians had the swagger of invincible titans; see how they shrivelled when the wind changed! They claimed to hold the power of life and death over their subjects. But what power did you have when you were too squeamish to use it?

Boraqashti had looked from face to closed-off face, and understood that he was the only man willing to do what needed to be done. He had, in a sense, been chosen.

He had left without saying a word.

He stood now in the central courtyard, feeling himself sweat under his cloak. He realised he was tapping his foot with impatience. He put a stop to that immediately: others might have thought it weakness.

Eventually the first of the prisoners was brought out. In deference to the importance of the visitor, both the boy’s hands and ankles had been tied. He hadn’t walked so much as hopped into position, arms held tightly by guards. When finally released from their grip he slouched against the concrete wall, his body limp from whatever misfortunes he’d suffered since his arrest. Looking back later, Boraqashti was surprised to find he had no recollection of the boy’s face. It had been the rope around his wrists that struck him: yellow and fibrous, like baling twine. Rustic. Out of place in this setting. An odd, incongruous, utterly irrelevant detail.

Boraqashti wasted no time: enough had been wasted already by others. He held out his hand to a bodyguard, clicked his fingers irritably when the man appeared to hesitate. Quickly, and rather forcefully, as if that would erase the initial reluctance, the bodyguard placed the butt of the gun in the imam’s hand.

“You,” he said to the boy. “State your name.” The boy said nothing. Exasperated, Boraqashti turned to the warden, who filled in the blank for him. “You are tried with the crime of sedition. How do you plead?”

The boy said something in reply to this, quietly, but Boraqashti wasn’t listening. He had only asked because there was protocol to be observed, and it would be simpler if all this was nice and legal. But before the boy could finish he’d grown impatient, and wrapped it up with a wave of his gun. “Your testimony is insufficient. By the authority of God and State you are hereby found guilty.”

The prison warden, who had been standing at a distance, said something which Boraqashti ignored. It might have been a quiet plea for mercy on the boy’s behalf, or possibly a prayer.

Boraqashti raised the gun, sighted along it. He was familiar with the weapon from his national service, and had been a decent shot once upon a time. Nevertheless, he was out of practice, and there was a moment of anticlimax in which he had to examine the gun again, frowning uncertainly, to make sure the safety was indeed off. The seconds passed in silent awkwardness, nobody knowing where to look. Then, satisfied at last, he aimed again.

Later, as his chauffeur drove him back to his home, Boraqashti had experienced a strange sensation. It was an emotion unlike any he had felt before. He scrutinised this feeling carefully, and found it to be elation.

He thought of the countless men, women and sometimes children whose deaths he had brought about by no greater effort than signing his name on a dotted line. Those who had never held such power, Boraqashti thought, would never comprehend the burden that placed upon him. The anguish he faced, every day, signing those death warrants. The tears a person less courageous, less certain of his own righteousness, might have shed.

Yes, he had killed. Yes, he had suffered. But was this killing, this suffering, comparable to what was going on near the border? Young men were being fed into the war machine in their thousands, and those who came back alive did so with scars on their bodies and contempt in their eyes. When they looked at Boraqashti, or any other of their so-called ‘leaders’, did they see an equal participant in the defence against invaders? Of course not. They saw bureaucrats and managers, men who knew nothing of combat. Who had never pulled the trigger.

Well, today, Boraqashti *had* pulled the trigger. This imam, this bureaucrat, had looked into a man’s eyes, had seen the fear there, had felt his heart contract with pity and a desire to forgive – and fired anyway. He had seen death close up, in all its ugliness and physicality.

He had done his duty to his great country. He had proved himself.

And night, in his prayers, he asked God that one day he would be allowed to prove himself again.

---

\noindent Ebri Hoz arrived at RaamTV Studios fifteen minutes late. The security staff knew him well enough by now to wave him in without comment. The head of the station, a balding man named Osrat, had been waiting for him.

“Mr Hoz!” he exclaimed, his face set in a practised show of delight. “How wonderful to see you again!”

“Oh, likewise,” Hoz said. He’d been here often enough to know his way around, and marched on past. Fazem, Hoz’s personal assistant, adroitly performed the task of opening doors ahead of them while never letting his eyes stray from the tablet he was tapping an email onto.

“We’ve reserved Prep Room Two for you, as usual,” Osrat said, struggling to keep up. “I was lucky enough to catch you on *Ramestan Today* this morning, talking about our beloved Supreme Leader. Your words were as moving and insightful as always.”

“Thank you for saying so,” Hoz replied, “But I can’t take credit. The voice might have been mine, but the words belonged to God.”

“Yes, surely.” Osrat’s tone was solemn. “Is there any...”

“News?” Hoz shrugged. “I thought that was *your* department.”

Osrat looked pained. “Very little information has been released from the hospital. And obviously,” he added quickly, “anything we did learn we would never broadcast without authorisation.”

“Very wise. This is a very delicate time.”

“Of course, of course. Mr Hoz, I appreciate how busy you are, now more than ever, but...”

Hoz knew what was coming. The little creep was still reeling from having one of his travel shows cancelled by the Purity Board.

It came down to one episode about the beaches of southern Italy. This episode had included a few long shots of beaches packed with tourists, and someone watching those segments claimed to have spotted a woman in the background sunbathing nude. It had been a long time since Hoz had been on the board, but the story had come his way, and he’d found it so amusing he had downloaded the episode illegally to watch it himself.

Hoz had worked at the policy end of the Purity Board, dealing with matters of ideology and management. He had never been, as it were, on the factory floor, and so had little idea how the checking was actually done. He had read once about the terrifyingly acute vision of birds of prey such as eagles, some of which could spot an ant on the ground from the height of the treetops, or a rabbit from kilometres away, and he could only assume that the Purity Board had recruited an army of these eagles, kitted them out with electron microscopes and state-of-the-art photo enhancement software, and given them nothing to do all day but pore over blurred stills of TV shows on the off-chance of catching something to be angry about. He had watched the episode several times and not seen any naked woman. Nevertheless, the show had been banned and the station was bracing itself for a hefty fine.

“...would be appreciated so very, very much,” Osrat said, straining to keep the wheedling tone out of his voice.

Hoz smiled sadly at him, shrugging helplessly. “Well, Os, you must know I haven’t been on the Purity Board for years now.”

“Oh, yes, of course,” Osrat nodded vigorously. “But even so, your inspiring leadership there must have left a lasting impression. Surely your words would carry as much weight there as they do whenever you give one of your famous speeches.”

“Os, you’re too kind,” Hoz said, giving a self-deprecating shrug. *You utter weasel.* “It really isn’t so simple, though...”

Osrat nodded assent, accepting the other man’s judgement. Then, as though on an unrelated matter, he said: “Incidentally, I have been reviewing the schedule for the next season of *Faith and Guidance* – you must know our current affairs program. We were thinking, it would be wonderful to have you on, explaining your vision for the future of Ramestan.”

“Oh, really?” Hoz said. “Me? I would be honoured.”

“The honour would be entirely ours,” Osrat purred. “We’re always ready to have an interview with – *a future President.*”

They both laughed at this – a little joke between friends. “Now now, silly,” he said, wagging a finger. “I haven’t announced any intention to run.”

“Of course not,” Osrat said, winking knowingly.

*God, save me from further prattle with this loser.* “Now that I think about it,” Hoz mused out loud, “I do still have some friends on the Board. Let me see what I can do about your – our – little problem.”

“Thank you so much, Mr Hoz. Ah – and here we are, your usual room,” Osrat held the door open for him and Fazem, who was still busily writing his email. “Please, take some time to refresh yourself. Is there anything you require? It’s so warm outside – perhaps a cold drink?”

*Yes, a fucking beer,* Hoz thought. “Water, with ice.”

“I’ll see to it, and send someone to collect you in a few minutes.”

Osrat backed out through the door, closing it gently. Hoz exhaled slowly, and turned to Fazem. “Anything?”

“He’s stalling,” Fazem replied, finally hitting ‘send’ and lowering the tablet.

“Does he say he’ll support me if I run?”

“He isn’t saying he won’t...”

“Backstabbing son of a bitch. After all I did.”

“Realistically, can we blame him?” Fazem shrugged. “Everything is in flux. If the Supreme Leader dies, we have no idea how his successor—”

“You think I don’t understand that?” Hoz snapped at him. Then, as an afterthought, added, “May God protect our beloved Leader.”

“May God protect him,” Fazem replied automatically.

“And where’s that ice water?”

“I’ll go check,” Fazem said, and slipped out of the room.

Hoz helped himself to a twig of grapes from the bowl on the coffee table, then dropped his bulk into one of the room’s sofas. The day’s papers had been laid out for guests. Every front page bore a picture of the Supreme Leader.

THE NATION WAITS.

OUR DARKEST DAY.

LET US PRAY.

Hoz looked at the old man’s face and scowled. *Of all the times to go, you pick now? God almighty. Hang in there, chum, for my sake...*

Hoz was seated with his back to the door, so had to turn his head when he heard it open. He started to ask why Fazem’s parents hadn’t taught him it was polite to knock, then registered the figure in the doorway. Hoz paused, mouth open, for a long moment.

“Imam Boraqashti,” he said, recovering smoothly as he rose to his feet. “What a delight.”

He might have asked how the old man had got in, but there was little point. Men like Boraqashti went where they wanted. The two of them squared off from across the coffee table, each taking the other’s measure.

Boraqashti looked, Hoz thought, boring. He looked like he worked in a bank, maybe, or in the central stack of some provincial library nobody ever visited. He wore the long black cloak and black headpiece of a mullah, but beneath that he was grey: grey shirt, grey beard, little grey metal spectacles with thick lenses. Grey hair – thicker, he noted with jealously, than Hoz’s own. He had skin that, under certain lights, looked grey and unhealthy. The man had some odd mannerisms, Hoz had seen, such as rarely making eye contact with people, preferring to look slightly down as if shy, gaze flicking up from time to time to check if they were still there. He looked harmless: an old man, frail as a cobweb, frightened and confused by a changing world he could not comprehend, spending his final years railing impotently at modernity in all its forms.

He did not look even a fraction as dangerous as Hoz knew him to be.

Hoz indicated a chair. “Please, friend, make yourself at home. Can I offer you anything?”

Boraqashti acted as if he hadn’t heard. “Hoz,” he said. He chose his words slowly and carefully, as if carving them on a tombstone. “Your speech today, the one they will show on the television programme. What will you say?”

Hoz fought back a smile. Boraqashti talked about TV like a man who’d only recently found out about it, and had only had it described to him rather than having seen it for himself. “I haven’t given it much thought. You know me, friend. I speak from the heart.”

“Not today,” Boraqashti told him flatly. “Your... *improvisations* have already caused embarrassment enough.”

“Embarrassment?” Hoz asked, all innocence. “For whom?”

Boraqashti said nothing.

“Any news from the hospital?”

“Our beloved Supreme Leader...” Boraqashti hesitated, deciding how much he should reveal to this politician. “...remains unconscious. The surgeons have done the best they could, but their assessment is bleak. He may not survive the day.”

Hoz blinked. Wow. *Wow.* “Thank you for telling me, Imam. In today’s broadcast I will lead the nation in prayer.”

“You will *not*.” Boraqashti’s eyes met Hoz’s for a fleeting instant. There was barely suppressed fury in that gaze, though his voice remained calm. “You know about the rioting in Ez Parz?”

“I’ve seen the videos online.”

“*Where?*”

Hoz smiled. “So your pet Guards can shut the website down? Please.”

“You think this is a joke.” Boraqashti’s voice was a rasp, as though rage was making speech difficult. “You *politicians.* Ez Parz is only the beginning. The Guard is stretched as it is, and you and I know there are factions within their ranks. While the Supreme Leader lives they remain united, but if, God forbid—”

“Yes, how many will *you* be able to count on?”

It was dangerous, but Hoz couldn’t resist. The emphasis was subtle, but its implications crystal clear. If the Supreme Leader dies, what will that mean for *you?* How much muscle will *you* have, my dear Imam, when chaos descends?

There was a knock on the door. Hoz went over to open it himself, leaning somewhat awkwardly around Boraqashti, who held his ground as if nailed to it. “Fazem,” Hoz said brightly. “Do come in.”

Fazem, with his jug of water, made it halfway through the door before recognising Boraqashti and jerking to a halt. The jug sloshed.

“Your, your, your excellency, I—”

“It’s all right, Fazem,” Hoz said, smiling broadly. “The Imam has just been giving me tips on handling the media in this time of crisis. Perhaps you could show him out?”

“Hoz,” breathed Boraqashti. “What you do today. There will be consequences. For us. And for *you.*”

“That’s entirely the point, my friend,” Hoz replied. “Do say a prayer for our dear Leader. Remember, while he hangs on to life, there is still hope. Try not to look so glum – or people might think you poisoned him.”

Boraqashti’s entire body stiffened, his eyes wide and white, nostrils flaring. In a spasm of rage his arm shot up, fingers curled into claws ready to rake Hoz’s eyes out. Visibly shaking, he stood for a moment longer, then stormed out of the room.

Panicking, Fazem looked from Hoz to Boraqashti and back, his mind unable to process what he had just witnessed.

“Well?” Hoz asked, eyebrows raised.

Fazem nodded, swallowed, spent an instant desperately searching for a place to put the water jug, then darted out to follow the Imam – at a safe distance.

When the door had swung noiselessly shut, Hoz allowed himself a brief chuckle. He had enjoyed that. He would be in a good mood for today’s filming.

He helped himself to an apricot, and as he sucked the fruit from around its stone a further thought made him smile: what if, one day, *both* their dreams came true? Because *surely* Boraqashti went to bed every night fantasising of becoming Supreme Leader. He doubtless thrashed himself with a birch branch for thinking such thoughts, but the idea would always be there, influencing his every decision, as long as even the remotest chance existed of his being next in line. And as for Hoz himself, well... he was ever the optimist. Official campaigning for the Presidency would begin soon. His name *would* be on the list. There was nothing stopping him now.

So: what if they both got what they wanted? Boraqashti as Supreme Leader of the clergy, and Hoz as President? What a team they would make! Hoz could have cried with laughter. *Oh, the fun we’d have together...*

Hoz shook his head sadly. It was just an idle fantasy. The reality was much simpler, much starker. There was no way, no way on Earth, that either one of them would allow the other to rise to power. The good Imam would rather die. He would also, Hoz knew, kill.

*But if it comes down to a fight between us,* Hoz thought, *Boraqashti will need to watch his back...*

There was a knock on the door. Hoz stood up.

It was time to start shooting.

## I

It would have been fair to say that Malaf’s feelings towards Qaseh were complicated.

She’d liked him in uni; had enjoyed their long arguments, which usually started in the shisha bar or café and ended with one of them sneaking past the other’s dormitory wardens so they could continue, in ironic whispers, late into the night. She’d liked his cool radical politics, and had helped herself liberally to the contents of his bookshelf.

It had been obvious, from day one, that he fancied the pants off her, but this did not put her in a particularly exclusive club: Qaseh was after every girl on campus. And, once she’d made it abundantly clear that she would rather claw out her own eyes, or better yet his, than sleep with him, but that she *was* rather interested in borrowing that English-language copy of Lenin’s *The State and Revolution*, they had got on perfectly passably.

Qaseh was already a competent programmer before he got to uni. For him, the degree was a distraction from his real mission, which was to make connections. He was at every party, every society meeting, every protest march. He looked good in a suit and knew how to talk to power; but what he really liked was finding the fringes, the dangerous edges of society where people spoke freely and did what they liked.

Really, this was just a matter of degree: there was a certain level of baseline illegality every Ramestani citizen had to be comfortable with merely to function. Qaseh simply took it one step further than most, and more creatively. One day he interrupted Malaf’s exam revision by dumping a bunch of padlocks on her textbook and demanding that they learn to pick them. They stayed up past midnight working them out. She barely scraped a pass on the test the next morning, but the locks got opened. Later that week, one of their lecturers complained that someone had broken into his office. He didn’t say if anything had been stolen, but Qaseh had turned up at Malaf’s that evening with a bottle of rum he said he’d found somewhere.

The Ez Nezeshti fiasco changed everything. All their anarchist bravado suddenly seemed infantile after their encounter with genuine career criminals and armed drug dealers. If anyone wrote Malaf’s life as a coming-of-age narrative, that chapter would be the turning point: the end of stupid risks.

Now, looking at Qaseh and the others, she wondered if she had been the only one of their gang to react in this way. Qaseh had changed even less than the others. He still thought he was smarter than everyone else: the police, Guard, the Supreme Leader and President and all their various lackeys. It drove her crazy to see how little he had grown up.

Post-reunion, how she felt about Qaseh troubled her. Why couldn’t she just accept that he was an idiot and move on, leaving him behind now as she had years earlier?

In part, she had to admit, it was because of an unspoken accusation. A question had been dumped at her feet the moment they had been reunited. Qaseh was still fighting. So were the others. Why had *she* been so quick to lose her nerve?

So spending more time with Mr Qaseh was not something Malaf looked forward to with any great enthusiasm. Their meeting would be strictly transactional: she would trade what she knew about Ros Khesri for what Qaseh had found about Lineh. They would meet, swap data, and depart having spent as little time as possible interacting like normal human beings.

And yet, despite all this, when she knocked on his door, she was holding a box of cakes.

Buying them hadn’t been a conscious decision. Decades of social conditioning made it simply unthinkable that she could visit a person in his home and not bring something sweet to eat. And so, on the way to the metro station, she had ducked into the bakery at the end of the street. Their speciality was a meringue filled with thick cream and dusted with white chocolate. She’d bought one for each of them.

As she handed over the money, she’d felt a strange sensation of *déjà vu*, as if this action was something that should resonate with her in some way. She couldn’t put her finger on it, and shelved the thought for later.

Qaseh’s apartment was on the fourth floor of a building near the Technical University, not far from where they had eaten their picnic after Malaf had been released from the police station. The building was in good shape, and living there couldn’t have been cheap. Malaf wondered what Qaseh’s day job paid; wondered what other income streams he might have, under the taxman’s radar. Holding the cake box in the crook of an arm against her chest, she paused for a long moment, steeling herself; but when she knocked, it was with gusto.

“Is that you, Malaf?” came Qaseh’s voice from inside. “The door’s unlocked.”

No tripwires, no steel plating? No hidden cameras? Malaf smiled to herself. Perhaps the security freak was losing his edge.

She stepped into a short hallway and took off her shoes and headscarf. She unbuttoned her long jacket and draped it over a nearby chair. “Where are you?” she called.

“In here.”

‘Here’ was a living room with a couple of sofas in it. A TV tuned to one of the British news channels sat in the corner, unwatched by Qaseh, who was lying on his belly, in the middle of the room, with his hands tied behind his back.

Malaf looked down at him impassively.

“I’ve brought us some cakes,” she said after a while.

“Put them in the kitchen, please,” Qaseh said, twisting his head to look up at her. “There’s tea brewing if you want it.”

Malaf left him lying there and went into the kitchen. She rummaged through his cupboards until she found a glass, then helped herself to the contents of his samovar. “Do you have sugar?”

“Small pot on the left hand side.”

“Thank you.”

“You’re very welcome.”

Malaf stirred a spoonful into her tea and went to the window. Ez Raam’s blocky buildings stretched out into the smoggy distance. Clear days were a rarity this time of year, but she imagined that on those days the view would have been impressive. She was envious: all she could see from her apartment was the apartment mirroring hers across the road.

Glass in hand, Malaf returned to the living room. Qaseh was still lying there. She regarded him over the rim of her glass as she sipped. His wrists had been bound with a thick white cable tie. Another was drawn tight around his ankles. He was on his side now, feet together, a curled-up position that made Malaf think of a caught fish, thrashing about on the deck of a boat. Malaf wondered what the word was for what a fish did when it came out of water. Drown? That didn’t seem right. Fish in air were doing the opposite of drowning, surely. She made a mental note to look into this when she had more time, then sat down on a sofa.

“Your geologist,” she began.

“Khesri. What about him?”

“You said you were investigating him. What about?”

“I told you before, we’re *not* investigating him,” Qaseh said. “We’re looking at PetRaam.”

“The oil and gas company, right,” Malaf thought out loud. “And he teaches courses on petroleum geology.”

“I’m impressed. You’ve been looking him up online?”

“No, he told me this morning.”

“You spoke with him?” Qaseh raised his eyebrows. “Why would you do that?”

“Because you mentioned he was connected with Lineh Parkiesh.”

“Again, not *quite* what I said,” Qaseh corrected her, raising a finger of his bound hand. “RaamCo Construction Finance moves money around for big construction projects. PetRaam uses its services. When you mentioned you were interested in Lineh, I, as a good friend, looked her up. It turns out she works for RaamCo. Hence the interest.”

“I still don’t get it,” Malaf said. “Khesri consulted for PetRaam. PetRaam uses RaamCo. RaamCo employs Lineh. There’s a lot of links in that chain.”

“We have... *obtained* some documents,” Qaseh explained, careful what he was giving away. “From a man who claims to be a PetRaam employee.”

“What kind of documents?”

“All kinds. Maps. Spreadsheets – those are mostly incomprehensible. Emails. All from years back. But there’s a couple of documents in particular that stand out. I won’t go into details, but they relate to business between PetRaam and RaamCo. Khesri’s signature is on them.”

Malaf shrugged. “So what? What’s the big deal?”

“On different documents, his signature changes.” Now it was Qaseh’s turn to shrug – a little awkwardly, given the restraints. “We don’t know what that means.”

“Huh.”

“You’ve probably noticed I’ve been tied up.”

“Mm. So, do you think someone forged Khesri’s signature?”

“That’s what it looks like.”

“Why?”

“We *think* we know, but it’s complicated. I don’t want to go into it – not until we know more.” Qaseh shifted his position on the floor; he looked uncomfortable. “Anyway, Khesri and RaamCo – there’s the connection. When I found out where Lineh worked, I wondered if she might know something about it. So I asked you. Dumb idea: the most recent document was from three years ago, long before Lineh joined. The dates don’t work out.”

“Ah,” Malaf said, smiling broadly. “But that’s not quite true. Khesri visited RaamCo, just a couple of weeks ago.”

Qaseh’s eyes widened. “Really?” He rolled over slightly, the tied-up equivalent of sitting to attention. “How did you learn that?”

“By talking to people, looking at things,” Malaf told him, unable to avoid a note of smugness.

“The old-fashioned way,” Qaseh said. “How quaint.”

“It works. Try it sometime.”

“And you spoke to him? To Khesri?”

“Over the phone. I... might have lied to him about working for RaamCo, then got caught out, then told him my name and where to find me.”

Qaseh stared at her, expression blank.

“What?” asked Malaf.

“That might have been a bad thing to do,” Qaseh said slowly.

“Regarding your investigation?”

“Regarding *you*.” Qaseh looked concerned – then irritated. “Look, do you think you might help me out down here?”

“You mean untie you?”

“Oh, you noticed?”

Malaf tipped her head on one side. “I’m going to make an educated guess here,” she said. “You did this to yourself, didn’t you?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Hmm. Well, out of a heartfelt but ultimately unfounded regard for humanity, I’ll rule out explanations involving this being some weird fetish you’ve only just discovered, and suppose instead that you were recently watching a YouTube video on how to break out of cable ties.”

“I was bored of picking handcuffs,” Qaseh explained. “You do enough of them, they all kind of blur into one.”

“How did you manage to tie your own hands behind your back?”

“With considerable difficulty.”

“I am the opposite of impressed.”

“You love me really.”

“So? What’s the problem?”

“It turns out it’s much easier to do if you’re standing up,” Qaseh explained. “The ankles were a mistake.”

Malaf shrugged. “Come on, Qaseh, you’re not going to let a little thing like that stop you, are you?”

Qaseh grinned at her. After a few moments of wriggling he got to his knees. From there he shuffled over to the wall, where he used its support to get to his feet. He wobbled alarmingly as he stood; Malaf, bored, checked her phone for messages.

Nothing from Lineh.

“All right,” Qaseh said. “The theory is: if you bend forward like *this*, you can bring your arms up like *this*, and then bring them down hard like *that*.”

He demonstrated in slow motion for her. Qaseh’s wrists were tied behind his back. He intended to jerk both arms violently downwards so that his wrists would be forced apart by his hips. Done correctly, she could imagine how this would put enough stress on the cable tie’s ratchet mechanism to break it. She could also imagine it being rather painful.

She got to her feet. “I’m going to help myself to some more tea.”

“You’re not going to watch?”

“No, I’ll catch the summary on the evening news.”

Malaf went into the kitchen and poured herself another glass. She found two dry plates in the washing rack and picked them up along with the cake box. Her back was still to the door when she heard a muffled snap.

“Mother*fucker!*” Qaseh screamed.

Malaf returned to find Qaseh sitting on the floor massaging a wrist. The cable tie was lying open on the floor. His eyes had watered.

“How was it?” she asked.

“I can see why the bloke in the video wrapped his wrists in gaffer tape first,” Qaseh said through clenched teeth. “God’s balls...”

“How are you going to do your ankles?”

“With fucking *scissors.*”

When both cable ties were finally off, Qaseh flopped down into a chair looking miserable. He sat with his arms folded in a way that let each hand rub the opposite wrist. Malaf pushed the cake box and plate in his direction. “Well, at least we know you’re safe from kidnapping by electricians.”

“Hmm.”

“You suggested that me calling Khesri might have been bad for my health. Why?”

Qaseh looked up, then away, almost shyly. “It’s better if you don’t know the details,” he said.

“You are so full of shit, Qaseh.”

“I’m not kidding. The fewer who know about this, the better. The documents we’ve received, if they’re authentic, point to something big. A real scandal. Something the Enemy would much rather nobody knew about.”

“Uh-huh.”

Malaf had heard stories like this before, and was unimpressed. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe Qaseh. She knew as well as everyone else that the country was run by a cartel of corrupt and brutal thieving murderous scumbags. When it came to conspiracy theories, the thing that always stretched credibility was not that the government would do something evil; it was that they would bother to try hiding it. What they did openly was outrageous enough.

“Well, fine,” she said eventually. “Be all mysterious, if it makes you feel important.”

Qaseh pretended to look hurt.

“So Khesri visited RaamCo two weeks ago. Why?”

“I don’t know.” Qaseh shrugged. “What did he tell you?”

“Nothing. He clammed. Wouldn’t discuss his reasons even when he thought I was working for RaamCo. You think it had something to do with someone forging his signature?”

“Who knows?”

“I also asked if he knew where Lineh was.”

“And?”

“Again, nothing.”

Qaseh shrugged. “Again, why would he?”

Malaf said nothing, sipping her tea. After a few moments she asked, “So, do you have anything for me?”

“Yeah,” Qaseh said, reaching into the box and lifting out a cake. “I’ve done a bit of digging online, put out a few feelers.”

“And?” Malaf couldn’t help feeling a thrill of excitement. “What have you found out?”

“Not a lot, I’m afraid.”

“Can you at least tell me the last time she was active online?”

“She?” Qaseh looked puzzled for a moment. “I wasn’t looking for info on Lineh.”

“You weren’t?”

“No, it was your dad I was interested in.”

Evacuate the air from a room and its temperature will drop in accordance with the ideal gas law. The look Malaf gave him made Qaseh’s ears pop. Ice formed on the windowpanes.

“I think I liked you better tied up,” Malaf said.

“I was thinking about what you said the other day,” he explained, ignoring the sudden chill. “You mentioned your father invited you to a party. Were you still planning to skip it?”

“What business is it of yours?”

Qaseh looked momentarily baffled, as if the idea of something not being his business had never occurred to him before. A moment later, whatever seldom-used patch of grey matter he possessed for assessing other people’s mental state woke from its long slumber, blew dust out of its gears, and began working furiously on this new input. His eyes widened. “Wait wait wait. You think that I think Papa Sagheedi involved in the PetRaam thing,” he said. “That’s not what I meant at all. This is a new conversation. PetRaam thing over. Draw a line under it.”

Malaf folded her arms, waiting.

“Look, I do have some rules,” Qaseh went on. “Your family is off-limits. If your dad is doing anything wrong, I wouldn’t investigate.” Malaf’s glare intensified. Qaseh found himself backtracking again. “Not that I think he *is*. He’s fine. He’s the most upright state official in Ramestan. It’s weird, frankly. Not that I’ve especially looked. I’ll shut up.”

Malaf eyed him warily. Her father’s political career was something she preferred not to think too much about. In person, she knew him to be as honest and decent a human being as one could reasonably expect to be in this country. She had always told herself that this decency would map exactly onto his professional life, and had deliberately not looked for evidence that might prove her wrong. Perhaps this was why she and her father had grown apart somewhat over the years. If she got too close she would see the cracks.

What’s more, she was hardly squeaky clean herself. If they were closer, would any of her bad karma transfer onto him? Could her father survive, politically, if he *really* knew his own daughter?

“So: the party,” Malaf said coldly after a long silence.

“You know who Ebri Hoz is?”

Malaf frowned. “I’m sure I’ve heard the name.”

“Bit player in Parliament, used to be on the Purity Board. Real sleazeball.”

“If you say so. What about him?”

“He’s coming to your dad’s party.”

Malaf raised her eyebrows. “Well. Either Dad’s moving up in the world or Hoz is on his way down. How did you find that out?”

“Oh, weeks of deeply impressive hacker stuff,” Qaseh said. “Also, he tweeted it.”

“Hoz?”

“Mmm-hmm. Probably to see if he can win any supporters for a presidential bid. So we’re very interested in him, who his friends are, what he talks about. But it’s like you said: there’s only so much I can find out by looking online. You need boots on the ground. Insiders.” He gave her his most winning smile. In English, he said: “*You catch my drift, girlfriend?*”

Malaf looked at him stonily.

“Well, think about it, anyway,” Qaseh concluded, lamely. “You haven’t eaten your cake.”

“I don’t want it any more.”

“Mine was nice.”

“Hmm. I wish I’d poisoned it.”

---

\noindent She kept the cake in the end. Making a point was one thing, but it would have violated a higher principle to let good chocolate go to waste.

She was furious that Qaseh had tried to persuade her to act as a spy for him, operating under her own father’s roof. The nerve of it was incredible, and what galled her even more was the fact that he had succeeded. She would go, no question. She remained undecided about how much intelligence she would relay to Qaseh, who could go to hell as far as she was concerned; but for the sake of satisfying her own curiosity, it would be too good an opportunity to miss.

Malaf stepped out of Qaseh’s building and into the evening warmth. It wasn’t far from here to the ‘garden’ between the highway lanes, but Malaf didn’t fancy her chances scrambling up that hill with a cake box held underarm. Instead, she took a long walk past the Technical University. It was an area she knew well: there was an entire city block devoted to books and CDs on language learning. Neon signs blinked at her in scripts she barely recognised: Bengali, Ge’ez, Hangul, Lao. When she had been a student she had spent a lot of her free time here. She would pick up a book on a language she’d never heard of, sit down on a sofa, and immerse herself in irregular verbs and indirect objects, thinking about anything but her coursework. Cynical in her youth, she had believed that having a purpose in life, a so-called calling, was a complete crock; a lie they told you to keep you in line. How had she have been so blind to the fact that *this* had been hers?

She found the small square where she liked to sit. It would have been overselling it to call it a park: the main area was concrete and stone, with a channel of water running down its middle to a small fountain. The fountain was turned off in the summer when water was scarce, but in the spring and autumn the sound of its splashing had made this a spot of rare peace in Ez Raam’s endless racket.

Malaf was alone. She sat on a bench, shut her eyes and turned her face towards the sun. In half an hour the shadows of buildings would make this place cold and dark, but for now at least it was warm, and it was hers.

She opened the cake box, took out the cake, and bit into it, filling her mouth with sugary sweetness. For a moment it was heaven.

And then, memory jogged by that taste, she realised what had been bothering her when she had been queueing in the bakery.

She had remembered the last time she’d bought them as a gift for someone.

---

\noindent “Oh, my *favourite!*”

Lineh threw her arms around Malaf, very nearly crushing the precious box. Malaf was rocked back by the unexpected hug, and gave her an awkward one-armed squeeze in return. They air-kissed in the doorway, then Lineh led her inside.

“I’m so glad you came,” Lineh went on. Then she stopped, frowning. “I mean... I should say... *Bonsoir, ma cherie.* Is that right?”

Malaf smiled encouragingly. “*Très bien, mon amie.*”

“Wait. *Mon?* Not *ma*?”

“*Oui. C’est mon*.”

“But I’m female.”

“Ah, but *amie* starts with a vowel, and that overrides it.”

Lineh threw up her hands. “Pfff. I give up. I give up! Come on in.”

As Malaf unlaced her boots, she looked up and noticed Lineh’s ceiling. In the hallway, and on into the living room, the whole place had been hung with kites. They were the two-string ones meant for high-speed acrobatics. Brightly coloured and streamlined like raptors, they were unfolded and ready to fly at a moment’s notice. They rocked slightly with the air currents, casting overlapping coloured shadows as Lineh shut the door behind them.

“Something smells good,” Malaf commented.

“Burning love,” Lineh said, mysteriously, and beamed at her. “Come into the kitchen,” she said. “I’m almost done.”

This was the first time Malaf had seen Lineh outside the context of Café Kesh. Lineh had always come straight from the office, which meant Malaf had only ever seen her in work clothes. She was one of those people, Malaf thought, whose dress style made you feel slightly unkempt in comparison. Her hair made Malaf’s hair feel greasy. It was jarring to see Lineh in jeans and a T-shirt; Malaf, who’d put in a special effort with her own appearance, now felt awkwardly overdressed.

Lineh unfolded a small stepladder in the corner and instructed that this was where Malaf must now sit while she cooked. Malaf was surprised she owned a stepladder: Lineh was very tall, and had no difficulty reaching every shelf in the kitchen.

“Now,” Lineh told her, “the final stage of this culinary masterpiece will require a superhuman feat of concentration, so while I do this, you tell me how your day’s gone.”

Malaf’s latest translation project was a minor academic paper on the impact of Ramestan’s prewar social security system on national health. She gave a half-hearted account, knowing how boring it would sound to an outsider given how tedious she herself was finding it. Lineh made occasional grunts of encouragement that suggested she wasn’t paying much attention. Malaf watched her cook. She knew from their talks at Café Kesh that Lineh’s hobby was dancing, and she had a dancer’s way of shifting her weight when standing still, as if constantly rehearsing to some inaudible tune.

“Did I tell you I have a sister called Malaf?”

“No, but I’m not surprised.” Malaf smiled. “Everyone’s sister’s called Malaf. It’s one of those names. Is she in Ez Raam?”

“No, she got out years ago,” Lineh explained. “Lives in Copenhagen.”

“What does she do there?”

“She’s a physicist. Works at a company that makes lasers, I think. She got all the brainy genes.”

“Do you see her much?”

“On Skype, fairly often. In the flesh... maybe six years ago?”

“She doesn’t come back?”

Lineh shook her head. “No, she refuses. She’s one of *those* expats.”

Malaf knew what she meant. The experience of leaving Ramestan tended to be fairly polarising. The diaspora split into two camps: those who desperately pined for the motherland’s food, its beautiful climate and its warm, loving, carefree people; and those who remembered only religious intolerance, massive restrictions on free speech, constant fear of being arrested for wearing the wrong clothes, and an economy crushed by sanctions and ubiquitous corruption. Neither side fully described a country Malaf had ever lived in.

“The last time I saw her was when I visited her in Denmark,” Lineh went on. “Actually,” she added with a laugh, “I slept on her sofa for about six months. It’s where I learned to cook this. Ta-da! Burning love!”

Burning love, or *brændende kærlighed,* turned out to be a hash of meat and onions, served on mashed potato, with an egg on top. Since bacon was as hard to find in Ramestan as alcohol, and the product sold as ‘pig-free bacon’ was somewhat suspect, Lineh had had to substitute thinly sliced beef.

“What were you doing for so long in Copenhagen?” Malaf asked her as they ate.

Lineh grinned. “Believe it or not, I was in a band.”

“Really? Playing what?”

“I never learned an instrument. I mean, I had a few guitar lessons once upon a time, but that never went anywhere. No, I sang.”

“What was your band called?”

“I don’t think we ever had a name – at least, not one that we all agreed on from one gig to the next. It wasn’t exactly a professional affair. The girl who played keyboards, she was Ramestani too. That’s how I met them.”

“What did you play?”

“Just covers of whatever pop songs. We had big ideas about performing our own material, but it turned out none of us knew how to write a song. Or carry a tune, or play most of our instruments, frankly.” She laughed, embarrassed by the memory. “It was a bit of a fiasco. We played in a couple of bars but eventually the money ran out, and my visa ran out, and my sister’s patience *definitely* ran out... So, here I am, back in Ez Raam.”

“Do you still perform?”

Lineh shook her head. “For a little while, for fun, but there wasn’t much point. Not for what I wanted to sing, or how I wanted to sing it.”

Malaf nodded grimly. The Purity Board had rules about what sort of music could be performed in public or recorded in a studio, and licenses had to be applied for in advance. Anything too up-tempo or Western-sounding was out. Most musicians stuck to traditional Rami folk tunes because it was safer. On top of that, licences were never given to bands with women as lead singers, in case their sweet voices inflamed men’s passions too dangerously. Naturally, women continued to sing and bands continued to play what they wanted, but those who refused to follow the rules would never make it big; would never risk becoming well-known. They could exist only at the fringes, underground, and with one eye on the people coming through the door.

Malaf, in turn, talked about her own life. Lineh was just young enough not to remember the war, so Malaf told stories of everyday deprivation, of her parents rushing her into a basement without explaining why, and hiding there, for hours at a time, playing merrily with her doll while explosions shook dust loose from the ceiling and made the lights flicker. These were stories anyone of her generation could have told, and she was afraid she was being boring, but Lineh listened raptly. They ate the cakes Malaf had brought, Lineh savouring every bite.

When they were finished, Lineh winked at her. “Now for the main attraction,” she said. She went to the bedroom for a few minutes, and returned with a small wooden box. Malaf cleared a space for it on the coffee table.

“This,” she said, grandly, “is *xiàngqí*.” Lineh spoke the name awkwardly, aware that this probably wasn’t how it was pronounced but doing her best anyway. “Chinese chess.”

The first few times they met at Café Kesh they had played backgammon. Malaf had lost every time, as usual: backgammon was a mystery to her, and whatever the winning strategy was, she had yet to figure it out. After a few games, Lineh had grown bored of so easily defeating her, and they had talked about other games they could play. Did Malaf like chess? Of course she did, and she’d take Lineh to the cleaners at it given half a chance. Oh, but Lineh knew something better than chess.

*Better than chess? Impossible.*

*Really? Well, come over to my place some time and I’ll show you.*

Folded up inside the box was a square of red fabric. Lineh spread that out on the table, smoothed it flat. It was marked with grid lines, making a nine-by-ten playing board, divided in two by a wide gap. Lineh explained that the Chinese characters in the middle marked this gap as ‘the river’, and that certain pieces couldn’t cross it. The pieces were small, fat discs, with red or black Chinese characters printed on them. Malaf picked up one up and studied it.

“*Mă*,” Lineh told her. She traced the pinyin intonation in the air as she spoke. “That means horse. It moves one point horizontally or vertically, then another diagonally.”

“Like the knight in normal chess?”

Lineh gave her a reproachful look. “*Western* chess, Malaf. Stop *othering*. But yes, it moves like a knight, except it doesn’t jump.”

Lineh took her through them piece by piece. Some had analogues in Western chess: xiàngqí’s chariots behaved just like rooks. Elephants and soldiers were similar enough to bishops and pawns to hint at the two games’ common ancestry. Xiàngqí’s cannon was something new: it moved horizontally or vertically any distance, like the rook in chess, but could capture an enemy piece only by jumping over precisely one other piece. Malaf asked Lineh to explain that one twice; it was neat.

“It’s a lot to learn,” Malaf said, looking at the unfamiliar characters. “The soldiers and the chariots look the same.”

“There are differences. Look closer.”

“My elephants look different from yours.”

“And French has gendered nouns. Stop whining.”

When she’d finished describing all the pieces, Lineh set them up in their starting positions, letting Malaf copy her on the other side of the board. She explained the basic strategy, which was not too dissimilar to that of Western chess. That done, she invited Malaf to make the first move, which Malaf took to be as good an opportunity as she was likely to get for her to do what she’d been wanting to do since she’d first met Lineh, which was kiss her, gently, on the lips.

(Not that this was *really* a first move. To call it such would ignore the days and weeks leading up to it. The quiet signals: the touch on a sleeve, the lingering eye contact. Hinting, probing. Nothing spoken, everything deniable. And then the growing certainty, but also the fear: does she know that I know that she knows that I know that she knows...)

The kiss went on for a long time, or seemed to. Very slowly Malaf pulled back. Beside her on the sofa, Lineh had hardly moved a muscle.

Panic swept over her. She had got it wrong. She had misjudged the situation completely. She had brought disaster on them both.

She stared at Lineh, frozen, and waited, her heart racing.

Lineh looked into Malaf’s eyes. She inclined her head slightly. The expression on her face said: *Yes? And?*

Malaf felt such relief that without Lineh’s hands keeping her steady she might have fallen off the seat. Lineh stretched out on the sofa and pulled Malaf down on top of her as they continued to kiss. Soon Malaf felt Lineh’s fingers exploring her shirt buttons, her belt buckle. Half-undressed, they limped in a tangle of clothes to the bedroom.

Not a lot of xiàngqí got played that night, if Malaf recalled correctly.

---

\noindent Malaf stayed on her park bench until the sun had sunk below the buildings around her, lost in thought.

It occurred to her that not once did she spend the night with Lineh. There were too many nosy neighbours on that street, too many twitching curtains. The risk of discovery had been minuscule – and anything short of being caught actually in the act could fairly easily have been explained away – but Lineh had insisted. Malaf felt a pang of regret at that. She wished she had woken up beside her, even once; wished that she had that memory.

She checked her phone, hoping, praying, for a notification. A sign of life. But all she saw was a black screen, dimly reflecting her own image in the fading light.

*Lineh,* she thought. *What has happened to you?*

Sighing, she opened vVhisper.

> **MALAF S:** These messages are secure, right? Nobody is going to read them. Ever.
>
> **QASEH J:** It’s the most secure channel I know. What’s on your mind?

There was a long pause as Qaseh digested this. There wasn’t even the little icon showing him tapping away on the other end of the line. He was just staring at the words, deciding. When the pause became unbearably long, Malaf started typing again.

> **MALAF S:** You won’t have to go inside with me. I’ll do all the work. I just need another body. Someone to watch the road.
>
> **MALAF S:** Someone I can trust.

After sending, she stared at that last word in that message to Qaseh, wondering if it had really been she who’d written it. It certainly didn’t *sound* like her...


\vspace*{50px}

## II

Malaf awoke to the sound of gunfire.

She sat up quickly, fighting the sleeping bag. She looked around frantically. She was the tent’s only occupant. A tangle of clothes lay where Irooj had slept. Malaf dimly remembered stumbling over to the tent and trying to sneak inside without waking her. Doubtless she’d made a racket, but nothing could compete with Irooj’s snoring.

More shooting. She turned her head rapidly to try to gauge its direction, and immediately wished she hadn’t. She could feel her brain bumping around inside her skull, could feel the blood throbbing through her frontal lobes. It had been a *lot* of vodka.

She was tempted to try going back to sleep, but knew it would be impossible; and, if her compatriots were indeed in the process of murdering each other, she felt obligated to try to prevent it, or at least to find a decent place to watch it from. Cursing under her breath, she wormed her way out of the sleeping bag, finding that she was fully dressed underneath. She found a single shoe near the entrance of the tent; the other was some distance away, for reasons unknown.

She peered inside the other two tents and saw they were empty. The bonfire had burned down to ashes. Their two cars were parked nearby, with the Sixty’s boot wide open. Malaf, ever the city girl, wondered if that was safe, then remembered where they were and how ridiculous she was being.

She saw no sign of the others near the campsite, but suspected they were nearby. After drinking some water from a bottle in the car, she set off into the empty town, following the sound of shooting.

The tarmac of the road she walked on was largely intact, but strewn with chips of masonry blasted from the buildings on either side. The shops were skeletons, with broken bones of twisted metal jutting at odd angles from the rubble. She peered in through their windows. Everything of value had been taken years ago. Some looked like they were places where soldiers had holed up: their facades were spattered with bullet holes, their interiors blackened by fire. These had all been small businesses. Malaf knew that elsewhere in the town were buildings that had once stood three or four storeys tall, but had now slouched as if made of slow-flowing liquid, spilling concrete into the roads below.

More gunfire. Closer now.

Malaf came to a street corner and peered around the wall of a building. She saw them: Qaseh, Boraz and Abeej were standing with their backs towards her. Abeej was doing the shooting, with Qaseh and Boraz keeping a safe distance. They had set up some chunks of debris along the street at various distances to make a target range, and were having a very jolly time trying to hit them.

Malaf wondered where Qaseh had got the gun.

There were a number of ways one could obtain a gun legally in Ramestan. Postwar, the government had pushed strongly the idea that each citizen should take personal responsibility for the defence of the nation. This started early. Malaf cringed when she recalled her school sports lessons: gymnastics, badminton, hockey. She had a mental picture of herself, viewed from outside: a small-boned shivering creature wrapped in black, holding a hockey stick and wishing she was back indoors. The sports rotated through the seasons, and she had the distinct impression they waited for the coldest part of the year to do the ones that involved spending the most time standing outside waiting for the ball to come her way. But for two hours, twice per year, the rhythm was broken. Their all-girl school received a visit from stern-faced old men in uniform. At the front of the gymnasium, with the regular teachers watching nervously at a distance, the soldiers opened their ruggedized green boxes and brought out automatic pistols, submachine guns, and an eggbox’s worth of hand grenades. The guns’ firing pins or whatever had been removed, but they were the real thing, and the girls’ job was to dismantle them, oil them, and reassemble them. They were timed, and given a grade on their report card (which Malaf remembered her father looking at with an unreadable expression, then filing away without comment). Later on, starting at age sixteen, she and her classmates were taken outside, given rifles, and told to hit a photocopied image of an onrushing American GI. The target was placed quite a distance away, and Malaf recalled feeling a certain amount of pride in once or twice putting a bullet through the paper soldier.

For girls, these sessions were their only encounter with firearms. They either enjoyed the distraction or didn’t; either way, they learned for the exam and then forgot about it, along with trigonometry and how to solve quadratic equations. Boys leaving school, however, had to face two years of compulsory national service. This was a bit of a joke: the criteria for exemption were so vague and easy to meet that many young men actually served almost no time at all. When Malaf met Qaseh, she assumed he’d been one of those who’d dodged it, citing medical problems, or theological objections, or simply never turning up. But she had been mistaken: Qaseh had been first in line at the registration office.

The reason, too, surprised her: Qaseh *loved* guns. It was the one point where his intense nerdiness, his love of classifying and recognising and sorting, intersected with the real world of hard objects. He knew the make, manufacturer, magazine capacity and rate of fire of every gun in every action movie he had watched. In fact, it was his love of guns that triggered his interest in digital activism. He had become fed up of the government blocking access to the American gun blogs he liked to read, and spoken with people who knew how to get around them – and who had some ideas of how they might get rid of online censorship altogether. Thus one obsession had sparked another.

And so it was hardly surprising that he had, somehow, got his hands on a working handgun; still less so that, given the chance to spend a few days in the desert, he had thought it might be fun to bring it along and get in some target practice. None of this made Malaf feel any better about being woken up this way.

“Hey!” she yelled when the latest volley subsided. “Assholes!”

Qaseh and Boraz turned, grinning like naughty children. Abeej, who was wearing ear defenders, took a moment longer to notice.

“Good morning, comrade!” Qaseh called. “How’s the head?”

“Mm. I think I’m going blind. What poisonous crap do you put in that vodka?”

“I don’t remember you complaining when you did that little dance around the bonfire.”

“Dream on, buddy.” Malaf squinted along the street. The boys’ target range had been constructed from whatever small objects hadn’t been looted from the shop fronts. It looked like there had been more misses than hits.

“Want a go?” Abeej asked, offering her the ear defenders.

Malaf spared a distasteful look at the gun in his other hand, and shook her head. “Where are the other two? I forget their names. You know, the ones who aren’t lunatics?”

“Irooj and Tusham went for a walk together,” Boraz said. He gestured to a yellow and black plastic box clipped to his belt: one of the two-way radio handsets. “Want me to give them a call?”

Malaf shook her head. “I’ll find them myself. After breakfast.”

“Okay, but don’t take too long,” Qaseh said. “We still have a lot of driving to do. I want us to rendezvous at the campsite in an hour. If you’re not there in time, well, this would be a really sucky place to get left behind in.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.”

As she turned and stalked off the way she came, Boraz took the gun from Abeej, put on the ear defenders, and took aim.

---

\noindent “Hey! Down here!”

They spotted her before she saw them. Malaf had guessed, correctly, that Tusham and Irooj would head for the river. Before the war it would have been pretty, and even now the destruction lent an awful kind of poetry to the scene. The water level was low, the river almost embarrassingly easy for a competent swimmer to cross. It was crazy to think that this river, and a couple of stone bridges across it, had been all it took to turn this scenic little town into a slaughterhouse.

Tusham and Irooj were sitting on the riverbank. Irooj had rolled up her trousers and was letting her feet dangle in the moving stream. They were holding hands, and Malaf’s first impulse was to turn away and let them enjoy the moment. But Irooj beckoned cheerfully, so Malaf strolled over.

“Hey, chick,” Irooj said. “How are we feeling?”

“Pretty good. For breakfast I murdered Qaseh and feasted on his corpse.”

“I can see you two are still crazy about each other,” Tusham commented. “No target practice for you?”

Malaf shook her head, and sat down beside them. She scooped up a handful of small stones from the ground and began to flick them, one by one, into the water.

“I was just thinking how weird it is to have you back with us,” Irooj said to Malaf. “Especially now. It was such a shock to hear the name Ez Nezeshti again, but there it was, in Mr Obid’s documents. And I didn’t say anything to Qaseh or the others, but I was thinking it: couldn’t we get Malaf to join us? I know we’ve not spoken in years, and you probably wouldn’t have been interested in our work... but, you know, just to complete the set?”

Malaf shrugged, not knowing what to say.

“That must have been the first time I’d thought of you in a while,” Irooj went on. “And then Abeej calls to tell us you’re in trouble, and only a few hours later, there you are, eating a meal with us like no time had passed.”

“Hell of a coincidence,” Tusham added.

“Just the universe’s way of keeping us on our toes,” Irooj said with a grin.

A silence passed between them, with nothing to hear but the gentle movement of river, and the occasional faint plop as one of Malaf’s stones disappeared into the water. After a while, Tusham asked, “Did you find her?”

Malaf nearly dropped the stone she’d been holding.

“Find who?” she asked, after a moment. To her, her voice sounded strange, not like her own. It was like the voice in a dictaphone, played back to her.

“Your friend. The one you were looking for. What was she called?”

She spoke the name softly: “Lineh.”

“That’s it. Lineh. Did you find her, in the end?”

“No. No, I didn’t.”

“But you found out what happened to her?”

“Oh yes,” she said quietly. Malaf reached for another handful of small stones. “I found out what happened to her. In the end.”

This seemed to satisfy Tusham, but Irooj watched Malaf carefully, trying to understand exactly what she meant. She was about to ask a question when a squawk from nearby startled them. It was the radio, left on a nearby rock beside Irooj’s shoes. Sighing, Tusham got to his feet, and walked over to answer.

“All right, comrades,” came Qaseh’s voice. “Time to march.”

---

\noindent They left their camping equipment where it was, freeing up a lot of space in the cars. Malaf, Boraz and Qaseh rode in Qaseh’s car, while the others followed in the Sixty. As before, Qaseh’s car had zoomed ahead, leaving the others far behind.

Qaseh spoke into the radio: “Are you lot taking the scenic route, or what?”

“We’re rattling around like dice in a box,” Irooj replied over the shortwave. “We should have brought the water tanks as ballast.”

“Instead they brought me!” Tusham grunted, which got a laugh.

The road to Ez Nezeshti had been a driver’s paradise compared to this one leading out of it. They were driving north along a narrow desert road, leaving long plumes of dust in their wake. Boraz was navigating. On his lap was the old road map, which he was using in conjunction with the more modern geological survey maps that had come with the leaked documents. In his hand he held a small electronic device which Malaf soon identified as a GPS receiver. It looked like it was army surplus: tough grey and green plastic, no display except glowing red numbers for latitude and longitude.

The car was full of boy talk: guns and ammo. Now Boraz had got Qaseh started on 3D printing, how easy it would be to download a design and churn the things out – if anyone would give him a 3D printer he could spend some time with. Malaf tuned it out and stared out of the window, watching the nothingness pass by.

“You’re very quiet back there, Malaf,” Qaseh said after a while.

“Don’t worry, I’m still here.”

“Enjoying the view?”

“Yes. Some lovely dirt around here.”

“Hey, don’t knock the dirt,” Qaseh scolded her. “This is very special dirt. High quality, good, solid, Ramestani dirt.”

“That must be why so many people keep trying to steal it from us.”

“And with good reason! It’s all there in Mr Obid’s documents – if you know how to read that kind of a map. You know all this used to be underwater? If we’d got here a couple of hundred million years earlier, we’d be swimming with the dinosaurs. Imagine that!”

“Go on talking. If I look like I’m sleeping, it’s because I imagine better when my eyes are shut.”

“Technically,” Boraz put in, “they wouldn’t have been dinosaurs.”

This threw Qaseh off track. “They wouldn’t?”

“Nope. Dinosaurs lived on land.” Boraz smiled. “When you talk about *swimming* with them, you’re thinking of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs, or some other genus of marine reptile. Not dinosaurs.”

“Well excuse *me,* Mr Paleontologist,” Qaseh said. “Anyway, dinosaur or not, they’re all dead now. Every last one of them. Such a shame. But hey: in a sense, they’re still with us, because it turns out, a lot of those dinosaur bodies got all bunched up together and buried deep underground. There’s a whole layer of them down there. Sadly, the conditions weren’t right for them to be fossilised, so we won’t be hanging them in a museum. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have their uses...”

Malaf nodded, slowly. “You’re talking about oil.”

“I’m talking about oil,” Qaseh said. “How far now?”

Boraz consulted the GPS. “We’re really close. We should be able to see it.”

“That’s why we’re interested in Khesri,” Qaseh said. “Apparently, he was once hired as a consultant to assess Ramestani crude oil reserves that had previously been passed over, but with new drilling technology might now have become economically viable. He took one look at the maps and said, to whoever: why yes, we should absolutely start drilling here. Which is why, a few years ago, the government spent huge sums of money on the Ez Nezeshti Region Hydrocarbon Extraction Project, and the construction of one of the most impressive oil rigs the country has ever seen.”

Malaf frowned. “Here?”

“More like...” Boraz consulted his map, and pointed ahead of them. “There!”

Qaseh decided now would be a good time to bring the car to a stop. As the dust settled around them, Malaf scooted around so that she could look between the two front seats and out through the windscreen. She followed Boraz’s finger, which was pointed into the desert. She squinted into shimmering haze, looking for the gleam of metal on the horizon.

“See it?” Boraz asked. “The oil rig, there, in the distance.”

Malaf frowned. “No.”

“Just there. Massive thing. See it?”

“No.”

Boraz chuckled, shaking his head.

Malaf sensed she was being made fun of. “What’s going on?” she asked. But Boraz just opened the car door and got out.

“Okay, wiseass,” Malaf asked Qaseh. “Where is it?”

And Qaseh laughed, and replied, “Where indeed?”

## III

Malaf would have walked right past the Internet café if she hadn’t been paying attention. The place hadn’t gone out of its way to advertise itself, probably to avoid attracting a surprise inspection by the Guard. People would know it by word of mouth. It was in a basement, accessible by a set of narrow, uneven stairs; the only clue it existed was a chalkboard sign at street level, marked with a discreet @ symbol.

She pushed open the door and was hit by a blast of heavy, thumping music. The décor was geometric shapes done in black metal, weirdly lit by neon strips of green and purple. It was a vision of hi-tech futuristic hackerdom, as imagined by someone who didn’t know anything about it. A photo of Supreme Leader scowled down at them from its customary position above the door. His displeasure was evident, and Malaf found herself in agreement for once.

The place was deserted. Its only human occupant was a middle-aged man sitting behind a desk reading a novel. He was having to squint to make out the text in the gloom. Malaf wondered what happened when he went outside. Did his eyes get so used to these colours that the rest of the world was a bizarrely tinted negative?

The man hadn’t noticed her. She rapped her knuckles on the desk to get his attention. “Hey!”

The man looked up, surprised. His teeth and eyes glowed from UV illumination. “You won’t do any better here, ma’am.”

“Could you turn that music down?”

The man reached under the table and yanked a cable out of something. The silence was a physical relief for her. “Thanks. What were you saying?”

“I said, here’s just as bad as everywhere else.”

“I don’t understand.”

“It’s not your machine. It’s the whole damn network.” He gestured at the computers, each in its own little cubicle like a voting booth to give the users privacy. “These won’t do you any good, unless you want to relive the golden age of dial-up.”

“Oh *God*,” Malaf groaned. “How long has it been?”

“Just the last few hours.” The man shrugged. “My wife thinks it’s because of the riots in Ez Parz, but if you ask me...” He glanced at the door, then went on. “If you ask me, I reckon it’s because the Supreme Leader’s already dead and they don’t want us to know about it. Right now all the clergy are desperately trying to pick a successor, and quick, before anyone finds out there’s nobody running the show.”

Malaf chewed a knuckle for a moment, thinking hard. Eventually she sighed, and pulled a few banknotes out of her wallet. “Give me an hour’s worth.”

“Didn’t you hear? The Internet is *gone*.”

“Look, maybe I just want to play Minesweeper, okay?”

The man shrugged. “It’s your money, ma’am.”

“And a glass of tea.”

“We don’t sell drinks,” he snapped. Malaf opened her mouth to demand what sort of café, even an Internet café, didn’t serve tea; but before she could get the chance, he smiled at her, with a warmth she hadn’t expected, and said, “This one, I’m making you for free. You look like you need it.”

---

\noindent Malaf sat with her chin resting on arms folded on the tabletop, gazing up at the screen in front of her. The icon in the corner of the browser window continued to twirl, promising for the thousandth time that the webpage would finish loading *any minute now.*

Internet filtering was an everyday annoyance in Ramestan. When it targeted specific sites it was relatively easy to get around. It was rare that the government really pulled the stops out like this and hit everything at once. She tried to remember the last time it had happened. It must have been in the weeks leading up to the last presidential election, when the more moderate candidate had looked like he’d stood a chance against the hardliners. That had spooked them enough to cut off the Internet to the entire country for a few days. By the time the ban was lifted, the candidate was under house arrest. That had been years ago; he was still locked up.

She stared at the loading icon glumly. Malaf remembered the good old days of progress bars, where you at least knew that the data was coming, however slowly. Now there was just this: a spinning disc, assuring you that things were progressing well, like a spokesman of a failing business saying all’s well while the share value crashed and interns fed documents into the shredder.

Waiting forever for a page to load was such a boring, humdrum annoyance. She couldn’t believe she had survived the madness of Ez Nezeshti... to return to this.

*They had brought a gun.*

She thought back to that time – incomprehensibly, only a couple of days ago – when they had all met up in the underground car park of Qaseh’s apartment building. Malaf had stood aside, watching sulkily while the others loaded up the cars.

It was just before they were due to leave that Qaseh had had his bright idea. He’d taken Irooj aside, and asked her, quietly, if she wouldn’t mind bringing along a new toy he’d like to play with. Irooj had readily agreed. By the time Malaf realised what it was, it was too late to try to talk them out of it.

*They had brought a gun.*

And, later, Ez Nezeshti had turned into a bloodbath.

She sighed. Her hand reached for the tea glass and found it empty. On the screen the loading icon continued to turn, signifying nothing.

---

\noindent Head down, walking slowly, Malaf thought: *Factions.*

<!-- would rather this ^^ was just the word Factions in italics, but can't make that render properly. -->

The pavement was cracked and uneven beneath her feet; it had been laid and relaid and built upon many times without anything old being taken away. Power cables ran down the sides of buildings then snaked loosely over the ground before disappearing into unmarked holes in the concrete. She was careful not to trip. Everywhere, the faint smell of gas: tiny leaks from shoddy piping, not big enough to catch fire, not expensive enough per day or month or year to be worth fixing.

*Factions,* she thought again. She could still hear Qaseh lecturing her, as if he was telling her something she didn’t already know. *You have to understand the Enemy if you’re going to survive.*

In school they taught the official picture. The posters hanging on classroom walls had a coloured box labelled ‘Parliament’, and above that, linked by many arrows showing the flow of political authority, sat the President. The clergy had their own pyramid of dependencies; this was always included in any diagram of government, but was usually placed far off to one side, to signify that these wise men were concerned only with spiritual matters, and would never even dream of meddling with politics. Only the Supreme Leader had any overtly political role: an arrow joined him to the President, double-headed to show a degree of reciprocity, though no chart-maker who wanted to keep his job would ever show the President’s box sitting higher than the Supreme Leader’s.

That was the theory. Everyone knew that reality was not so neat.

It made no sense to talk of *the Ramestani government*. There was no such single thing. Nobody in the country rose to power without the permission, support, money and theological okaying of others already embedded in the system, and each of those owed their own position to yet other, more powerful persons, many of whom were more or less openly at war with one another. Alliances were made and broken, and beneath the surface factions ground against each other like tectonic plates. It was just about possible not to notice it happening: the state-owned media was always praising the government’s unity and cohesion. But then one day – or maybe, sometimes, in the middle of the night – something would fracture, and the forces that had been building up for years would be released, explosively, violently, murderously.

It was happening now, Malaf knew.

And she was right at the centre of it.

---

\noindent Maara lived in a building not far from Malaf’s, of the same squat, blocky design. It was closer than Malaf’s was to the huge marketplace of Ropeeri Bazaar, and the Ropeeri-Teshar metro station, which made it pricier, busier, noisier. It was nearly midday, and traders who couldn’t afford a stall in the Bazaar had taken up positions on the streets outside, hoping to catch some of the business going in and out. The pavements were so carpeted with goods that Malaf often had to walk in the road: pirated software, Rami translations of English bestsellers, a young art student selling her statues done in twisted copper. A lawyer in his seventies sat at a folding desk with a typewriter on it, offering notary services for a flat fee. He wore a dusty-looking suit on his top half, shorts and sandals beneath the desk. He waved at Malaf and asked her if she’d had any changes of circumstances and would like to update her will. She ignored him.

Malaf’s only plan had been to find out what the aftermath of Ez Nezeshti had been. That at least would have enabled her to consider her options. Now, with the Internet cut off, doing even this looked impossible.

In the short term, the sensible thing to do was hide, and wait. But that kind of passivity wasn’t Malaf’s style. She had to do *something*. And as she walked, she kept returning to the same thought:

*Mr Obid.*

Mr Obid, who had leaked the documents. Mr Obid, who knew the truth about the oil rig. Who lived in Ez Raam. Who, presumably, could be found...

She was so lost in thought that she didn’t realise where she was until she passed a gigantic mural showing the Supreme Leader blessing the souls of this street’s war dead; and then she realised that she was standing directly opposite Maara’s apartment building. Between her and it stretched a highway, lunch-hour busy: six lanes of cars worming their way down a road wide enough for just four. The air was filled with a continuous drone of honking horns.

Malaf stopped and scanned the road for a safe-ish place to attempt a crossing. She looked at the entrance to Maara’s building – and felt her heart stop.

There were cars parked outside. Unable to find a place on the pavement they had stopped in the road itself, causing an angry swell of traffic to bunch up around them. They didn’t care. The Guard didn’t have to.

Malaf saw three of them straight away: young men in green uniforms, assault rifles carried with the barrels pointing at the ground. They were keeping a lookout while others searched the building.

Malaf swore silently, mouth dry. They could only have been here for her.

Panic gave her tunnel vision: the edges clouded, flooded with static like at the onset of a migraine. She could see her heartbeat.

There, walking among them, issuing orders into his radio, was the man who had interrogated her after she’d been arrested. The man whose name she had never learned, and knew only as the Captain.

At exactly that instant, the Captain turned his head.

They were a considerable distance apart, separated by many lanes of screaming traffic. At that remove, the apparent size of each of the Captain’s eyes could only have been a tiny fraction of a second of arc. There was no possible way that Malaf could discern an iris or a pupil, let alone determine the direction he was looking. And yet, in that moment, there was absolutely no doubt in her mind that Malaf and the Captain had locked gaze. It was there in the body language – the way his whole body had been in the process of turning, getting ready to address a subordinate, but then suddenly jerked to a halt. The complete stillness that followed. The stunned recognition.

*You!*

Malaf took a faltering step. She felt everything slow down: it was like walking underwater. Another step. Another.

The Captain was pointing at her, one hand raising a whistle to his lips. Beside him, the nearest Guard had noticed, and was beginning to raise his rifle.

\vspace*{50px}

## I

“There’s this thing I’ve been working on,” Qaseh told her. Malaf wasn’t surprised: there generally was.

They were in Qaseh’s car, stuck in night-time traffic. They had hoped to avoid the worst of it by taking a short cut the wrong way down a one-way street, and although Qaseh had been unlucky and got into an extended horn-honking contest with an oncoming vehicle which they had then had to squeeze past millimetre by millimetre, the tactic had probably been successful in shaving a few minutes off their ETA. Nevertheless, traffic jams, like taxes and Internet filtering, were a fact of life, and they were to some extent resigned to it.

They had been stationary for a few minutes now, bumper to bumper with the cars around them, and as always, word of the stalled vehicles had spread rapidly. Considered purely in terms of GDP, traffic jams during daylight hours were bad news, since they reduced people’s capacity for productive work; but by night, that loss was surely offset by a vastly sprawling shadow economy that depended entirely on selling commodities to this temporarily captive consumer base. Before long, Malaf had to wind up her windows against the stream of people weaving between the idling vehicles. They tapped on the glass, holding up packets of cigarettes, pirated DVDs, fresh flowers, dried figs, cups of steaming hot chocolate. They offered to read her fortune, check her tyre pressure, pray for lost loved ones, do her nails. Malaf ignored them, but found that doing so meant paying attention to Qaseh, which was arguably worse.

The thing that Qaseh had been working on was sitting in the footwell of Malaf’s seat, which was where she had shoved it when she learned what it was, hoping that nobody would be able to look through the window and see its blinking LEDs. Not that anyone would be able to identify it from its physical appearance: a circuit board, a few coloured wires and a some batteries, all bound up into a neat parcel with electrical tape. It sat there, listening.

What it was listening to was WiFi traffic.

Malaf knew, like most people, that obtaining a list of nearby WiFi networks was as easy as looking at one’s phone – something she did every time she entered a coffee shop to see if she could get online for free. If she saw a strong network she would join it, asking the staff for a password if one was needed.

What she hadn’t appreciated, until Qaseh had explained it to her, was how much more information you could pick up if you knew how to look. For example, it was staggeringly easy to find out what *other* phones were connected to the network. And you didn’t actually have to *connect* to a network’s wireless hub, with a password, in order to do this: since all devices were constantly, silently, exchanging information over the open air, all you had to do was set up a suitable monitoring device, and listen.

For someone like Qaseh, this stuff was pure gold.

And so Qaseh had built his contraption. For less than the price of a dinner for two and coffee after, he had assembled a small, battery operated phone sniffer.

For the last few months, Qaseh had been doing this every time he found himself outside a Guard station, he had paused to see what wireless networks were available. If he found the one the Guards were using, he turned on his device. A few minutes later he had the IDs of every mobile phone in the building, stolen from right out of the Guards’ trouser pockets. Technically none of this was illegal, but since the Guards, technically, were unprincipled sadists with machine guns, it was something he did from the safety of a moving car, making the best possible use of every traffic slow-down.

That was the first part of the thing he was working on. The second part concerned another interesting quirk of how mobile phones operated.

“When you’re walking around on the street,” Qaseh explained, “unless you turn the setting off, which no one ever does, your phone is constantly looking for a network to join. How do you think that works?”

“I don’t care.”

“Most people think they do this by just listening for nearby wireless networks and then asking to join. But that’s not quite right. What happens is, a phone constantly sends out *probe requests*. These requests basically say, ‘I am phone X, am I on your list of allowed devices?’ Think about that. Your phone is *constantly broadcasting its ID.*”

So the box by Malaf’s feet did two things. In one configuration it collected Guard phone IDs. The rest of the time, it listened for those IDs in the wild. It detected probe requests, extracted the identifying information, and compared it with an internal database. If it saw a match, it would raise an alarm.

In early versions of the device, the alarm had been a shrill beeping sound, warning Qaseh that there was danger nearby. One day, Irooj had pointed out that this was a dumb idea: an unidentifiable tangle of electronics that made a noise whenever a Guard was nearby would attract precisely the kind of attention he had built it to help avoid. And so the alarm had been replaced with something more subtle. An LED blinked red for danger. Green meant all clear.

To date, when Qaseh had taken the box out with him on the streets of Ez Raam, the only LED to light up was the green one. He had not received a single warning. In his estimation, this could mean:

<!-- CHECK THAT THESE LETTERS RENDER PROPERLY! I've seen them render as numbers -->

a) that Guards were considerably more tech-savvy and disciplined than they appeared to be, and switched off their phones’ wireless functionality when they were outside their place of work;

b) that patrolling Guards in plain clothes were very rare, and he had simply never encountered one in the wild;

or, more worryingly, c) that these plain clothes Guards existed in such staggeringly huge numbers that his paltry shortlist of phone IDs represented only a tiny fraction of a vast, ubiquitous secret police network, so terrifyingly numerous as to dilute his meagre findings to the point of uselessness.

“Or the LED is bust,” Malaf pointed out.

Qaseh pretended not to hear her.

---

\noindent When they finally reached Kharo Tolhedi (Martyr) Avenue, traffic was still slow enough for them to take their time moving past Lineh’s building. Qaseh drove with one eye on his wireless monitoring device. Malaf took off her seatbelt and scooted down in the passenger’s seat, hoping this would be enough to hide her.

“Well,” Qaseh said, “no warning signs.”

“Which means precisely nothing.”

“True, but I’m also thinking: if you do get arrested again, at least I’ll know for sure there’s something wrong with my box. Good to know, either way.”

“That’s you all over, Qaseh. Always looking on the bright side.”

“I’m a ray of sunshine. Want me to circle round again?”

Malaf nodded. On their second pass she sat up straighter in her seat so she could see better. She tried to look into cars, scan the faces of the occasional pedestrians.

Could the Guards still be here, staking out the building, watching for signs of life? They had been on the night of Malaf’s arrest, but that had been days ago: surely they would have got bored of it by now. But then, why had they been interested in the first place?

“See anything suspicious?” he asked her.

“No.”

“Me neither.”

Qaseh found a convenient place to park. Convenient did not mean legal: the place was so crowded he had to park at a street corner, so far onto the pavement that pedestrians would have to climb up into his bonnet to get past, and sticking out so far into the road that only motorcycles and the very thinnest of cars could squeeze past without a scraping noise and an exchange of paintwork with vehicles already parked there. Malaf got out and started walking.

“Best if we stick close together,” Qaseh pointed out. “If they’re watching out, they’re watching out for a woman walking alone.”

Malaf grumbled, but saw the logic, and paused to let him fall in beside her.

“How are we going to do this?” he asked.

“Her place is on the ground floor,” Malaf told him. “She has a front door that goes directly into hers; the door to the left gives access to the rest of the building and the flats above.”

“What kind of lock on the door?”

“I don’t know. The ordinary kind.”

“*The ordinary kind?* Malaf, whatever happened to you?”

“There’s garden at the back. Same arrangement of doors: one that’s Lineh’s own, one for the rest of the building.”

“A wall around the garden?”

“Yes.”

“Then probably the lock isn’t as good on that door. And we’d be hidden from the street. That’s our way in.”

“One problem with that,” Malaf said.

“Let me guess. How high is the wall?”

---

\noindent “Okay,” Qaseh said after a while. “I am undeterred.”

Malaf and Qaseh were standing in a narrow corridor between two rows of walled gardens. The space was just wide enough to walk a bicycle down, with sturdy metal doors giving access to the gardens themselves.

The wall could have been a lot worse. In other parts of town it might have been topped with barbed wire or bits of broken glass. Here the wall even worked in their favour by acting as a screen: they were nicely hidden while they made their plan. Once they were over it, they would be fully exposed to view from the buildings on the other side. The sun had set long ago, but street lights lit the world in harsh sodium yellow. They would have to take the risk, and hope nobody was looking out of their window.

“Reckon you can lift me?”

Malaf stared at him. “I can’t tell if you’re being serious or not.”

“Of course I am. I’m a serious man.”

“How much do you weigh?”

“Look, we didn’t bring a ladder, did we? And correct me if I’m incorrect, but aren’t you a little out of practice with your lockpicking? I can pull myself up, I think – I just need a little more oomph.”

He showed her a cradle of his hands, fingers intertwined. Malaf sighed, and copied him.

The next few minutes’ activity made Malaf even more happy nobody could see them. At various junctures, Qaseh was using her clasped hands, her shoulders, even her headscarved head as support in his climb over the wall. He made two main attempts: one exploratory poke of his head over top to make sure nobody was watching; then, having shed his coat and anything that might fall out of his pockets, a final heroic clamber that ended in a painful-sounding thump as he plopped down on the other side.

“Are you all right?” Malaf hissed.

“Lockpicks, please.”

Malaf threw the bundle over, then jogged round to the front of the building. She took her phone out of her pocket, scrolled down to Qaseh’s name. At the first sign of trouble she was to dial his number and walk away with it still ringing. Earlier, she’d asked what he would do if he *did* receive a call from her while he was trapped in a stranger’s home he’d just broken into.

“Improvise,” he’d said, and they’d left it at that.

Malaf waited, arms folded across her chest, resisting the urge to pace up and down. This, loitering outside Lineh’s house at night, was what had got her into trouble in the first place. No amount of family influence would save her if she got caught at it a second time. Still, she thought, if anyone was going to grab her, they would have done it by now.

She waited. Cars passed. She waited.

Finally a light came on in Lineh’s kitchen. She could make out Qaseh’s shadow behind the blinds, saw him reaching for his mobile.

“One minute, forty-five seconds,” were his first words when he called her. “I think that might be a record.”

“Do you see anything?” She realised as she said it that this was a stupid question. “Never mind. The front door key is on a hanger in the kitchen. Near the fridge.”

“Uh... got it. Now, I wonder how you know that?”

Malaf hung up without replying.

A little later, Lineh’s front door opened. Qaseh stepped out into the street, palming the key to Malaf as she passed him.

“Keep watch,” she said. “I’ll be as quick as I can.”

---

\noindent She did not know what she was looking for. Her eyes tracked over Lineh’s possessions, waiting for something to leap out at her.

It felt... normal. It felt exactly like she was in someone’s living room while the owner wasn’t there. That was all: nothing sinister, no sense of danger except what Malaf had brought with her. No disorder above and beyond what she had seen on her visits here. Nothing to suggest Lineh had packed her bags in a hurry. Nothing to say there had been any kind of struggle. It was as if she had popped out to the shops and would be back any minute.

Except she hadn’t come back. Malaf knew that as soon as she went into the kitchen. The place smelled of a bin that hadn’t been taken out. Dishes in the rack were waiting to be put away.

Through a door to one side she could see the tiny, unlit utility room. Inside: Lineh’s stepladder, neatly folded away. Her washing machine still had clothes in it. She’d put them in thinking she would come back later. Notes pinned to the fridge with little magnets. Some vouchers for coffee. A letter from her electricity supplier. A photograph of Lineh, with her sister, drinking in a bar in Copenhagen. She’d said that this was six years ago; she looked so young and happy Malaf could weep.

She opened the fridge and went through its contents. There was a whiff of gone-off cream. She examined the most perishable items and photographed their expiration dates. She would use that later to try to pin down the last time Lineh had gone shopping. When she shut the fridge door, an absence struck her.

Once, Lineh had taken a day off and Malaf had spent almost the whole of it with her, leaving only in the evening. They had eaten lunch on a blanket in a small park nearby, their bodies coming as close to touching as they dared in public. Malaf had a go flying one of Lineh’s kites. Later they had gone back to Lineh’s. It had been a Sunday, she recalled: Café Kesh was holding its usual French language social, but since their first evening together they had both lost interest in going. When Lineh had gone into the living room briefly to make a phone call, Malaf had drawn a heart on a scrap of paper, and written her and Lineh’s initials in it. She’d used the red pen Lineh kept for shopping lists. She’d pinned it to the fridge and left it there, saying nothing, waiting for Lineh to see it and be surprised and smile. It was a silly, childish gesture, but Malaf had been feeling silly that day, buoyed up and made light-headed simply by being in this place with this beautiful woman. Now, the paper with its heart drawing was gone. There were lots of ways Malaf could have interpreted that fact, but she guessed the right answer was the most depressing one: after their final argument, Lineh had removed it, maybe ripped it up, and thrown it in the bin.

Malaf left the kitchen and went into the living room. Her eyes lingered on the coffee table where they’d set up the xiàngqí board. That was where Lineh usually put her laptop in evenings. Something in Malaf ached at the recollection: sitting there with her on the sofa, a blanket over their bare legs; Lineh watching the film she’d put on, Malaf watching Lineh.

No laptop.

Malaf went into the bedroom. The computer wasn’t there either.

She left the bedroom briefly and did a quick tour of all the rooms, checking electrical sockets. Lineh usually left the laptop’s charger plugged in near the coffee table. Malaf looked there, but it looked like the charger had gone with the computer.

She went back to the bedroom and opened the wardrobe. The one time she had seen Lineh taking the computer out of the apartment, she had done it in a small backpack with a laptop compartment. Malaf couldn’t see the bag anywhere. Nor could she see Lineh’s favourite coat, the green one. That must have been what she had been wearing when she... when whatever had happened had happened.

Finally, Malaf went to the bedside cabinet, on the side where Lineh used to sleep. Everything was as it had been: the lamp, the mobile phone charger cord, the half-empty glass of water. Malaf picked up the book that was lying there, an English crime novel translated into Rami. Lineh hadn’t been much of a reader, Malaf recalled. From the folded-down corners, it looked like she hadn’t managed more than a few pages since the last time Malaf had been here.

Malaf opened the drawer of the bedside cabinet, and pulled out Lineh’s diary.

---

\noindent Another snapshot of memory: Malaf lying on the bed with Lineh’s head cradled against her chest. This must have been one of the last evenings they spent together. She stroked Lineh’s hair while Lineh watched something on her phone. After a long silence Malaf looked down at her and mumbled something indistinct.

“Mm?” Lineh asked.

“I said, I love you.”

Lineh looked up for a moment, a thoughtful expression on her face. “Okay,” she said after a pause, and went back to her phone.

---

\noindent Malaf sat on the bed and opened the diary.

She’d often seen Lineh scribbling in it; had wondered, especially towards the end of their brief affair, what it contained. There was a time when everything Malaf said seemed to make Lineh more angry with her, and on those confusing nights she would have given anything to know what the woman was really thinking.

A quick look told her she was going to be disappointed. The diary was page to a day, but most of the days had only a line or two written in them. Many were completely blank. Most entries were lists of single words, some of them crossed out to mark a job done.

She turned to the day when Malaf had first come to visit. The occasion was marked with a single line: *M — xiàngqí.*

Malaf turned to the next day. A shopping list: food items for the meal she would cook. A note to buy candles, chocolates. It was the night Malaf had brought a bottle of homemade wine, sourced from a friend of a friend for the occasion. It had cost a lot of money and turned out to be so sour they’d poured it down the sink after their first toast. At the bottom of the page: *M.*

She flicked through the other pages, reminding herself of the days they had met up. Lineh was careful: no details recorded, nothing that could get them into trouble if the diary was discovered and read. Just the letter, *M, M, M.* Malaf could have counted them all up easily: for all the impact of her time with Lineh, she knew the total wouldn’t actually be very high.

One day, after it had ended between them, another list. *Market: fruit, bread, cake. Shoes. Get cream.*

*Q.*

Malaf stared at that for a very long time.

## II

After their first attempt they went back to the car and reviewed the footage.

They were using Irooj’s mobile, at her insistence. “You have to use the same platform as your viewers,” she told them. “If people are going to share it on phones, it has to look good on phones.”

So they crowded around her screen and used their cupped hands to shield it from the sunlight. With the volume at maximum her little speakers made the sound of the breeze scritchy and unpleasant. They leaned in close, analysing its lighting and composition like judges at a film festival.

The trouble was, it was hard to film something that wasn’t there.

The video opened with a close-up of Boraz’s GPS receiver, held in someone’s gloved hand. The numbers were clearly visible: latitude, longitude, time and date. Once the camera had got a good look at it, the hand took the GPS receiver out of the way, revealing a desert scene, grey on blue. A man stood some distance away. On his body he wore nondescript dark clothing, and his face was hidden behind a black balaclava. And despite how hot it must have been under that balaclava, on top of it he wore a tall, green woolly hat with a cute little pop-pom on top.

“I look ridiculous,” Tusham muttered to Irooj.

“You’re fine, honey.”

“Can we do another one without the hat?”

“Absolutely not. It makes you stand out. It’s memorable. It’s media-friendly. It’s product differentiation. It’s *branding.*”

Qaseh waved them both quiet without moving his eyes from the screen.

In the video, Tusham was holding a square of white cardboard, on which was written: *Ez Nezeshti Region Hydrocarbon Extraction Project.*

Then the camera panned sideways, showing the empty wasteland around them. The area wasn’t completely without signs of life: years later, there were still bits of rubbish kicking around from whatever survey teams had been sent out here. A sun-bleached bottle of fizzy drink. Some cigarette butts. But nothing that would show up on the camera. They might as well have been standing on the surface of the Moon.

Slowly, the camera panned back to Tusham. Now he was holding another sign.

*Guess how much this cost you?*

When they edited it, it would fade to black. Now the raw video simply cut off. Boraz applauded cheerfully.

“It’s good,” Qaseh said, after a moment. “But I feel there’s something missing.”

“Isn’t that the point?” Irooj quipped. It earned her a few groans.

---

\noindent “Sanctions,” Qaseh was saying. “That’s what this is all about. How do you beat the sanctions?”

“Right, Qaseh,” Malaf replied tiredly.

“Steel, aluminium, all those things we’re not allowed to buy from the so-called Free World, because the Free World won’t sell it to us. Even though they *want* to sell it to us, even though the capitalists are *begging* for access to our markets. Because we’d only do something naughty with it, right? Can’t let those Ramestani maniacs make decent concrete. Ignore what they tell you about building hospitals or roads or airplanes that don’t fall out of the sky, all we want is to make noo-ku-lar reactors and take over the world, right?”

“Qaseh, I know all this.”

But Qaseh was fired up, unstoppable. He was in furious, righteous, full-throttle expository gasbag mode now. No force on Earth could have interrupted him. Malaf just stared straight ahead through the windscreen, hoping that Qaseh would do the same while driving. But no: he was turning in his seat, addressing all this to her, as if she was the last sceptic on Earth. He drove one-handed, barely noticing the road ahead, swerving over the uneven ground. *If we crash, at least I’ll die well-informed,* Malaf thought glumly.

“Not that we *want* these Western Imperialist imports, anyway! No, sir! We’ve spent decades locked in an ideological death match with the American infidels, and now you’re suggesting we *trade* with them? No, that would never do. We must remain firm! Remain self-sufficient. Of course, that does mean our bridges keep collapsing and our cars fall apart and nobody gets chemo when they have cancer, but who cares? It’s what God would want.”

“Hmm.”

“So look at us now. Look what a mess we’re in. The Imperialist hypocrites want to sell us stuff, but they can’t because of their own sanctions. We want to buy stuff from them, but we can’t because the Supreme Leader says we can’t. What a predicament!”

“If only there was some way around it, Qaseh.”

“*If only there was some way around it!*” he cried, thumping the steering wheel. “Some way of trading with the West *deniably*. Trade, but pretend we aren’t. They get what they really want, we get what we really want, and nobody loses face. The question is, how can you do it?”

“Why don’t you explain it to me?”

In the back seats, Boraz and Abeej listened attentively, enjoying themselves.

“Let’s say you want to build an oil rig,” Qaseh said. “In the middle of the desert. Say... in the Ez Nezeshti region. How do you buy the raw materials? Step one: you set up fake companies, hundreds of them if you have to. So does the Imperialist West. Your fake companies trade with their fake companies. You make friends overseas, friends in third party countries, countries that don’t have sanctions against us or don’t enforce them. You carefully construct a vast transnational money laundering network that lets you do business under the radar of the watching world.”

“Doesn’t anybody notice all this?”

“They could, I suppose, and lose all that business. They just choose not to.”

The quality of the road improved as they approached the town of Ez Nezeshti; it would get worse again only when they hit the old battleground. Qaseh made use of this window and put his foot down, sending the car screaming along.

“And after years of work,” he went on, “you have everything all set up. You’ve got the fake companies in place, you’ve bribed the right officials, misfiled the necessary paperwork. You set up the Ez Nezeshti Region Hydrocarbon Extraction Project, you gather the finances, and at long last you fork over the cash, issuing to the world a grand proclamation: build me an oil rig!”

He turned to her again and grinned.

“*But nothing happens.*”

Pause for effect. Malaf felt it was expected of her to gasp, swoon, or casually comment on his storytelling brilliance. She maintained a carefully neutral expression. Qaseh was not put off.

“You don’t understand it. You’ve paid the money, laid all the groundwork, so where are the troops of civil engineers you were promised? Where’s the steel? You’re about to phone up your suppliers when suddenly the phone rings and it’s *them* calling *you.* They want to know why you haven’t paid them. They’re waiting for their US dollars to come through. Nobody seems to know where the money is. And you don’t know either. It’s hard to understand, precisely because you designed it to be. But the more you look, the more you begin to suspect that some of these fake companies, they’re not *real* fake companies. They’re *fake* fake companies. Some of the friends you were trading with in third party countries, they were *fake* friends. The money moved around and around in circles, and then vanished. And someone, somewhere along the chain, has made off with *billions*.”

This made Malaf look up. “Billions? What, dollars?”

“Hmm? Oh. No, of course not US dollars. I mean *our* billions.” Qaseh caught Malaf’s look of disappointment, and backtracked quickly. “Look, currency devaluations aside, we are still talking a truly *vast* sum of money that has simply disappeared into thin air. Or, more accurately, into somebody’s pocket.”

“Hmm,” Malaf said. “So, who got rich out of this?”

“Nobody knows.”

“Wasn’t there an investigation?”

“On our side? I don’t know. Would there be?” Qaseh shrugged. “Think of what you’d be admitting to if you started digging. That you lost the money. That you were making deals with the enemy. They hang people for that kind of thing. And think of the public relations nightmare you’d have on your hands. It’s the kind of gaffe that could bring down a government, or at least a lot of the people in it. No, best to say nothing and hope the story stays buried. Think of the embarrassment if it got out.” He smiled broadly at the thought. He said it again, savouring every syllable.

“*Think of the embarrassment if it got out.*”

---

\noindent Their filming hadn’t taken as long as they had thought – after all, what was there to film? – and by early afternoon they were back at their campsite by the football pitch in the broken town of Ez Nezeshti. As usual, Tusham and Irooj lagged behind in the underpowered Sixty. Among Malaf, Qaseh, Abeej and Boraz there was a brief discussion, with a consensus emerging almost immediately: their work here was done. There was nothing left to see that they hadn’t already documented. The faster they could get home and start editing the footage, the sooner they could go public with what they had. The video. The maps. Mr Obid’s documents. They would put it together into a neat little media-friendly and *social media*-friendly package, ready for uploading.

“And what happens then?” Malaf asked.

Boraz’s hands mimed an explosion. *Kaboom!*

They began to dismantle the tents, loaded them into Qaseh’s car. When Malaf began working on the one she and Irooj had shared, Abeej stopped her. “Maybe we should ask the others first.”

“Irooj and Tusham? Why?”

“I don’t know. They’ve got their own transport. Maybe they want to extend the trip a bit, spend a romantic night under the stars.”

Malaf gestured at the crumbling, bullet-scarred buildings. “You call this romantic?”

“Maybe. For certain values of romance.”

Malaf just shrugged. “Let them decide. There won’t be enough space in our car anyway,” she said, and left it at that. “I’m going for a walk,” she announced. “Stretch my legs before the drive.”

---

\noindent Malaf walked without any real aim, thinking. She could have drifted down towards the river, following the path of least resistance, but she felt a sudden need for *effort*, for *overcoming*. And so she found a street that angled slightly upwards, and followed that, and at the next crossroads took a turn that took her higher still.

After many minutes of essentially going blindly onwards, she found herself in a part of the ruins she hadn’t seen before. She was standing in front of a building that must once have been a hotel. It was four storeys high, making it one of the tallest buildings in Ez Nezeshti. It was modern, and had probably been ugly even before the artillery went to work on it. Its front entrance was wide open, one door missing, the other hanging on by one hinge.

In their smuggling days, they had stayed out of any building that had taken this much damage. But Malaf reasoned that if it hadn’t fallen down in all this time, it would probably survive her added weight for a few minutes. Carefully she made her way inside.

The lobby was largely intact. She supposed that once this place might have reeked of decay and rot, but now, after so many years, it smelt of nothing. She walked past the reception desk and fought a childish desire to ring the bell for service. Turning right she could see the entrance to the stairwell. She went through and started to climb.

Embarrassingly quickly she was short of breath. Nevertheless, the climb felt good. She felt she was treading down the frustrations of the past days and weeks, crushing them underfoot, leaving them broken down below.

The stairwell opened into sunlight one floor too early. An explosion had knocked a gaping hole in the brickwork. It was as if the building had been sliced diagonally in two by a colossal swinging scimitar. The staircase’s handrail ran up the wall of the stairwell and then, when the wall crumbled away, kept going for a while into empty space, slightly bent and lost-looking. Malaf tested its strength, and when she was confident it was secure she leaned out as far as she dared, looking out at the wrecked town spread out below her. In the distance, on the main highway leading into Ez Nezeshti, she could just about make out Tusham and Irooj’s car approaching.

It occurred to her that this would be the last time she would ever see this town. A place with a lot of memories. She panned her gaze around, trying to feel anything at all about it, but found herself too tired, too emotionally drained, to care.

She felt suddenly ashamed to have come here. Doing so had put the Ez Raami side of things – the investigation of Lineh’s murder, and the punishment of those responsible – on hold. At the time, she’d told herself that coming out into the desert had been a necessary retreat, a way of pausing the action to gain the time she needed to think out her next move. Now, looking back, it felt a lot like cowardice. Things had started to get serious, and she’d run at the first sign of danger. *And you were supposed to be so tough.*

Well, never mind. In a few hours she would be back in Ez Raam. And the game would begin again.

Malaf took one last look at the skyline before going back downstairs. She looked again at the approaching vehicle.

She frowned, suddenly puzzled.

The site of the missing oil rig had been in the desert to the north of the town. Why were Irooj and Tusham approaching from the *east?*

In fact, now that it was closer, the vehicle didn’t look much like a Sixty, or any kind of car at all. It looked more like a van. The kind of thing builders might use.

---

\noindent Payim and Ressi had spent the last hour driving in black silence.

Normally this wouldn’t have bothered Payim, who was behind the wheel, shoulders cringingly hunched. Payim liked silence. He liked driving. It was calming, and the hours of essentially empty highway would normally have let him zone out into a muted, thoughtless inner world, returning to the here-and-now only when necessary to take a turn or deal with some minor hazard.

But this had not been one of those silences. This had been the kind of silence that followed one of his brother’s episodes.

Ressi had started the journey in a foul mood, and almost the entire first half of the drive had been an extended monologue on the topic of how much they were getting screwed over.

“Who the hell do they think they are, pushing me around like this?” he had muttered while chewing a fingernail. “Do the girl, they say. Never mind we’ve hardly had time to clean up after their last job. Do the girl. Tonight. Fine. Is it our fault she’s not home when we go in? *Is it?* Well *they* seem to think so, don’t they? *They* think we owe them. They haven’t even paid us yet, and *we* owe *them!* I should have kept my mouth shut about that map. I would have if you hadn’t distracted me. You’re as bad as they are. It’s just a map, for God’s sake! So what if the crazy bitch decided to make, you know, *annotations*. ‘Go to Ez Nezeshti.’ *You* go to Ez Nezeshti, you pair of lunatics. Do you think I’m *made* of time? I’m trying to run a *business* here!”

This was the kind of white noise Payim could have dozed off to; he didn’t mind.

The real trouble had started a couple of hours ago. They had stopped for petrol and to take a leak at a roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Weird place: there had been a tank parked outside, with a kid’s swing dangling from its gun barrel. Payim had wanted food. Ressi said they didn’t have time, but relented when Payim begged him. He gave Payim ten minutes to grab something while he looked at the guns hung on the walls.

Payim had wolfed down his food so quickly he’d felt ill afterwards, but had said nothing, and they were soon on their way. It was only later that Payim had made his mistake: Ressi had asked how much money Payim had paid for the food. Then he asked how much he had received in change. The numbers didn’t work out.

“*Moron!*” Ressi had screamed at him. “Can’t you do *one thing right?* You know how hard I work for that cash? You think I make all these plans and maintain contacts and everything else I do, just so you can piss it all away because you can’t *add?*”

That had been bad enough. But gradually Ressi’s stance had changed, shifting from his usual position, that his brother was too stupid to be trusted with anything, to something darker, something that made Payim even more uneasy: Ressi now believed that the restaurant’s owner had deliberately scammed them.

“And I *knew* he’d try something like this,” Ressi hissed. “I saw it when the man looked at me. He looked at me and he thought: here’s a pair of suckers. Look at them, with their workmen’s clothes and their muddy boots. They’re stupid, he thought. They won’t guess a thing, he thought. And even if they do, they won’t complain. They don’t have the balls. That’s what he thought of us, brother.”

“Ressi,” Payim insisted, “it was just a mistake.”

“No! No no no no *no*. No mistakes here. He knew what he was doing. I know a con job when I see one. This kind of thieving is the cornerstone of his business plan.” Ressi was spitting with rage by now, his voice a barely controlled scream. “And you know why he does it? He thinks he’s *better than us.* He thinks we’re stupid. He thinks we’re *weak*. That we *won’t – fight – back.*”

At which point, Ressi’s manner changed, so quickly and so completely that it left Payim reeling. His voice had become one of beatific calm and serenity.

“So, brother, when we’re done in Ez Nezeshti, you and I my friend, we are going to rectify matters.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, brother of mine, on our way back, we’re going to drop into this man’s happy little establishment. We are going to request an interview with the management. We are going to explain our position, calmly, as rational actors. We will lay out our grievances, and when we have had our say, we will kill him, right there in the diner.”

Payim didn’t look at Ressi. Kept his eyes on the road. “Ressi, maybe you need to calm down.”

“I am calm,” Ressi said. And he was: that was what worried Payim most. “Of course, we can’t leave any witnesses, so it’ll have to be the whole family we kill. The owner first. He looks like the type who’d keep a gun behind the counter. Take him out. Then the wife. Do you think they have any kids? I didn’t see any. Did you?”

Payim shook his head, and then did his best to drown out Ressi’s paranoia. In time it petered out, as these episodes usually did, filling the car with brittle, nervy silence.

When they were close to Ez Nezeshti Ressi told Payim to pull over. While Payim stretched his fingers, which had been gripping the steering wheel white-knuckled since they left the diner, Ressi went to the back of the van and checked their equipment.

“Waste of time, this,” Ressi grumbled. “She won’t even be here.” Nevertheless, he was a cautious man. He unpacked two handguns from their hiding place, made sure they were both loaded, and gave one to Payim, keeping one for himself.

“Come on. Let’s get this over with.”

They got back inside, and began their final approach to Ez Nezeshti.

---

\noindent Boraz, Qaseh and Abeej all heard the incoming vehicle at the same time.

“Is that the others?” Boraz asked, uncertainly.

Qaseh was puzzled too. “Not unless they found a better car out there.”

“It would explain why it’s taken them so long,” Abeej added, making light of it, to hide his sudden nervousness. He got up from his crouch and turned his head, trying to gauge its direction. “Want to go have a look?”

Qaseh hesitated. Despite what he had said about disaster tourists taking selfies among the ruins, that was pure guesswork. They had never seen any evidence that this town had been visited by anyone but them. Could it be smugglers from over the border? If yes, did they really want to make themselves known?

That said, Ez Nezeshti was a small town, and they were its only inhabitants. If Irooj and Tusham didn’t get back soon they would surely be discovered anyway. It would be best if a meeting took place on their own terms. Friendly, peaceful.

“All right,” he said, also getting to his feet. He held out the keys to his car to Boraz. “Stay here and watch our stuff, will you?”

---

\noindent “Oh my,” Ressi drawled, “what an impressively large number of crappy bombed-out buildings. What splendour. What joy.”

“I like it,” mumbled Payim, who was looking around with genuine fascination.

They nosed their van through the rubble-strewn streets at not much more than walking speed.

“Why couldn’t she have scribbled Ez Ashoor on her map, eh?” Ressi said. “We could have got a nice few days by the beach out of this. Instead we get sent to this shithole.”

“We could always just pretend to look for her,” Payim mused. “They’d never know.”

Ressi shot him an appalled glance. “I beg your pardon? Neglect our duty of care to our employer? Remember, Payim, it’s our *integrity* that separates us from the rest. Turn left here.”

---

\noindent Malaf watched from the hole in the wall of the hotel stairwell. For a few moments she had a clear view of the vehicle. It wasn’t one she recognised. She couldn’t make out the driver, but could see he had a passenger; could see a man’s arm dangling lazily out of the passenger’s side window.

Soon the van passed behind a building and out of sight.

The last she saw of it, it was heading straight towards their campsite.

---

\noindent “Stop!” Ressi yelped, leaping to attention in his seat. “Stop!”

Payim had seen it too. They had just rounded a corner and found themselves in front of a patch of flat ground that must have been a football pitch. And there, in the car park, was someone’s car.

“Well I’ll be damned,” Ressi breathed. “There’s actually someone here!”

They took it all in: the remains of the campfire, the two-person tent still waiting to be taken down, the boxes of food and camping equipment.

“Oh God,” Payim said quietly. He felt suddenly ill. Keep calm, he told himself. Pretend it’s not going to happen. Pretend you’re someone else. “Oh God,” he said again. “Oh God.”

“Get closer,” Ressi began to say, but cut himself off. A man had come out from behind the low wall where he had been crouching, maybe hiding from them. He was walking slowly towards them.

---

\noindent “Hello?” Boraz called. “Hello?”

He said it loudly. Not just to get the van driver’s attention, but to call back Qaseh and Abeej if they were still in earshot. *Where were they?*

The van had stopped a little distance away and was sitting put, engine idling. Its passenger side window was open, and the passenger had stuck his arm out. Now he was waving Boraz over.

“We’re just leaving,” Boraz explained loudly. “Out of here in a minute.”

“It’s okay!” the passenger called back. Boraz saw he was smiling. “It’s okay. Don’t worry about it. We’re not trying to chase you out. Come over, say hi.”

Boraz looked around quickly. No sign of the others. But the man in the van didn’t seem threatening. He shrugged, and came closer. As he did he got a better look at the van’s occupants. The passenger seemed completely at ease, grinning broadly at him. But the driver bothered him. He hadn’t looked at Boraz at all. Instead he was staring straight ahead, eyes apparently half-closed, hands gripping the steering wheel. The driver’s lips moved silently. Boraz thought he might be praying.

“So!” the van’s passenger said, cheerfully. “Nice place this, eh?”

Boraz snapped his attention away from the driver, focused on the smiling passenger.

“Been doing some sightseeing?” the passenger went on.

“Sort of,” Boraz said. “A little camping trip.”

“Great location. Isolated. Hey, that tent of yours, is that real canvas, or polyester?”

“What?”

“Looks like real canvas to me. Quality stuff. It costs more, sure, but you don’t want to skimp on things like that. That’ll last for years if you look after it properly. So, how many are you?”

“Why do you want to know?”

“No reason, no reason,” the passenger said, giving a little chuckle. Beside him, the driver was still muttering to himself, repeating his mantra over and over.

“And what brings you here?” Boraz asked, stalling for time. Where had everyone *gone?*

“It’s a long story,” Ressi said with a shrug. “Actually, I want to ask you a question about it. Now, I appreciate this might sound weird, and to be honest, five minutes ago I thought I’d never be asking it. This is as strange for you as it is for me, believe me. But: do you happen to know a woman named Malaf Sagheedi?”

The world around Boraz grew suddenly silent.

“What do you want with Malaf?” he asked hoarsely.

Ressi’s eyes went wide with delight. “You are *kidding!* She’s actually *here?* What the hell is she *doing* out here?”

---

\noindent Malaf ran down the hotel staircase, taking the stairs two or three at a time.

In the lobby she slipped on some brick dust, nearly losing her balance. Recovering quickly, she sprinted through the door and into the street.

---

\noindent “We’ve been trying to find her,” Ressi explained. “Man, you’ve really made my day.”

“What for?”

“We need to tell her something.”

“Tell her what?”

“That the fill valve on her toilet’s broken,” Ressi said, snickering at something that amused him privately. “Keeps overfilling. It doesn’t look like much, but if you don’t fix it you waste a *lot* of water.”

Boraz stared at him blankly.

“No, I’m joking, I’m joking. We’re actually here to deliver an invoice on some guttering work we did last month. We wanted to do by email but it kept going into her junk folder, so we thought we’d drive out here to tell her in person.”

“Listen, I don’t think—”

Ressi by now could barely contain his good humour. He was cracking up with laughter. “No, wait! Here it is, here’s the truth. It’s actually subsidence. Her entire building is leaning at an angle. Things keep falling off her bookshelves. We’re here to tell her there’s nothing to be done. Knock it down and start over.”

Boraz retreated a step.

“Hey,” Ressi said, voice suddenly cold. “Why are you walking?”

“I’ll be right back,” Boraz said as he continued to back away. “I’m just going to get my friends.”

“*You fucking stay right where you are!*” Ressi screamed.

The instant, explosive fury was enough for Boraz: at the sound of it he broke into a run.

Ressi turned to his brother. “Payim! Go!”

Payim snapped out of his trancelike state and stamped on the gas. He was too quick off the clutch: the van jerked forwards and then stalled. Swearing, he turned the key in the ignition.

“Idiot!” Ressi screamed. “He’s getting away!”

The engine started and the van roared forward.

Boraz ran as fast as he could, but the van quickly gained on him, heading straight for him. Payim gritted his teeth and closed his eyes as the distance shrank to zero. He braced himself for the lurch as the tyres crushed a body. But the impact didn’t come: Boraz leapt out of the way just in time, landing and rolling on the cracked tarmac. Ressi opened the door of the still-moving van and jumped out, stumbling as he ran.

Boraz hadn’t even got to his feet properly before Ressi killed him with a bullet through his brain.

## III

As she stared across the street at the men in front of Maara’s apartment building, suddenly everything in Malaf’s life was measured in seconds, half-seconds, quarters. She lost precious time gawping as the Captain raised a whistle to his lips and blew. Its shriek had to compete with the roar of traffic from the busy road separating them, but it still succeeded in attracting the attention of the Guards standing by the entrance. She watched their heads turn, their rifles go up in unison as though raised by invisible puppet strings.

There was no point being coy: she’d been spotted. Malaf ran.

She ducked around a street corner, quickly putting solid masonry between herself and her pursuers. How many were there? She’d seen three men armed with machine guns, and the Captain himself. There would be others in Maara’s flat. The Captain would have to radio them down. She had, she knew, a ration of time: not hours, not even minutes, just seconds; but maybe those seconds would be enough.

Car horns honked furiously. This was a busy road at the busiest time of the day, and somewhere behind her, the Captain had just stepped right into the traffic, hand raised in warning, whistle emitting a continuous shrill scream. Guard uniform or not, this was dangerous. Would his troops even follow? Probably: what the Captain could do to them later was scarier than an oncoming truck.

Malaf looked around, got her bearings. To her left: the mosque, the market. Bustle, crowds. She turned that way and ran for it.

The whistling was louder now, closer. When the Guards got to her side of the road and started moving at full speed, they would be on top of her in seconds. Malaf was running for her life, but the truth was that without a great deal of prior physical training, the speeds attained when running for one’s life weren’t much higher than when running for a bus. Her leg was screaming at her and she was out of breath already – but she had enough of a head start. She could already see the gigantic archway that was the market’s main entrance. She would make it.

Nearby she could see the blue-green dome and minarets of the mosque. Prayers were being called by megaphone: dear God, save the life of our beloved Supreme Leader. A procession of men and women circled the building, the women all wrapped in black. Malaf pushed her way across and through them, shoving and elbowing. She drew murderous looks from the worshippers, some of whose faces were wet with tears.

The whistling stopped.

Malaf couldn’t help turning to look behind her. When she couldn’t see over the bodies surrounding her she hopped up, once, to see better. An idiot move, she realised too late: she might as well have waved flag. She saw them in the street behind her, the Captain lagging behind now while his younger, fitter subordinates outran him, following the arm pointed right at her. Shit. *Shit!*

Running again, struggling against the growing density of people around her. They slowed her down, while she knew that behind her the crowds were parting for the men with rifles like silk slit open by a sharp knife. They were gaining on her.

But at last she reached the main entrance. The roar of the marketplace swallowed her, drowned out the sound of her pursuers. Under the great archway decorated with Ramestani flags, Malaf raced down a flight of uneven stone steps and flung herself into the tumult.

---

\noindent Ropeeri Bazaar was not the biggest market in Ez Raam, but at peak time the shoppers under its roofs could number in the tens of thousands. In past centuries it had been confined to the small square near its modern centre; over time, traders had colonised more and more of the surrounding structures. Towering stalls burst from parasitised houses and leant out over the street, and roofing arced out between buildings and met in the middle in a way that made a mockery of concepts like being ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ the market. In some places the space between shops was so tight two people couldn’t walk through at once. In others, wide open spaces were preserved by the sheer expense of the luxuries on sale, the price tags hanging from them like talismans to ward off loiterers.

Malaf was on her home turf here. When she needed everyday items, this was her main hunting ground. Now it was her turn to be hunted.

She moved quickly, her pace quick but just short of a run.

*Look calm,* she told herself. *No trail of chaos and turned heads. Disappear like a diver. Leave no splash.*

She kept to crowded areas, kept her head down. What was she wearing? Anything distinctive? The backpack stood out, but as it was full of money there was nothing she could do about it now. A brown long coat, easy to blend in with – but her headscarf was one of Maara’s, brightly coloured. That would have to go.

*Maara.* The Guard were looking for Malaf, and they’d found out she was staying with Maara. Maara the office gossip. *You’ll never guess who I was with last night...* Who had she told? How had word got to them so quickly?

She was in the women’s clothing district now. Headless mannequins showed off coats just long enough past the knee to keep you inside the law. Piles of T-shirts and leather jackets. Western logos were everywhere, the handwritten signs calling them one hundred percent authentic, because who knows, maybe Apple and Google really had released their own lines of blue jeans.

Malaf was torn. She could step into any one of these shops, and maybe her pursuers would walk right past her. But it would mean sitting still, holding her breath. She couldn’t do it. Not while running was still an option.

And then she saw a Guard uniform up ahead, and running became the only option.

She got only a microsecond glance at him as she spun around. She didn’t know if it was one of the men she’d seen before, heading her off, or if the Captain had called for reinforcements. Were all the exits now blocked?

The Guard bellowed at the shoppers: “*Stop her!*”

But above the sound of the market not many people heard him, and, this being Ez Raam, those who did hear didn’t react. Much easier to think it was a joke, or a piece of street theatre, or any other explanation that would let them off having to deal with someone in Guard uniform.

Malaf pushed her way through the crowd, shoving people aside, upending their grocery shopping. She emerged into a sudden high-ceilinged clearing. Turning left at a junction she sprinted out of women’s clothing and into herbs and spices. Bowls and bags of red and yellow powders, heaps of fruit. A shopkeeper who wasn’t looking pushed into her path a trolley loaded with sacks of pistachios. She skidded around him and nearly fell.

The Guard behind her, out of breath: “Stop or I’ll shoot!”

A bluff. Malaf kept running. Shoot, in this crowded area? *Surely* a bluff.

Another sharp turn down a spice alley, the sound of his footsteps close behind her. In an instant she saw her opportunity: in front of one of the stalls, a folding table decorated with bowls full of spices. Without breaking her step she reached out to one of them, spun around, and hurled it at her pursuer.

The bowl sailed through the air, leaving a comet’s tail of orange powder. The Guard ducked, but not fast enough. The bowl caught him on the shoulder. It didn’t break, but the impact sent an explosion of chilli across his upper body. Not a lot got as far as his face, but it was enough.

Sheer inertia gave the Guard a few more paces before he realised what had happened. Then he yelled, clawing at eyes that were suddenly on fire. Blinded, he crashed into another table, fell.

Malaf left him behind. But his screams of anger and pain would be sure to attract the others if he hadn’t already radioed them. They would be here any moment. She’d bought herself only seconds.

She didn’t get much further before she had to stop. She felt like her lungs had shrunk to the size of golf balls: no matter how deeply she breathed she couldn’t get enough air. *Too much shisha, Malaf. Not enough exercise and fresh fruit.* A shop nearby sold pots and pans. She made it to the door before folding up, bent double with hands on knees to stop her falling. Face red, sweat pouring down the small of her back. She felt sick.

A hand landed on her shoulder.

The weight of it was almost enough to topple her. She twisted violently, spinning around, ready to strike her attacker. To scratch and bite if she had to.

She turned and saw that the person who had grabbed her was a woman, aged perhaps fifty, dressed all in black. “Go,” this woman said, shoving Malaf firmly. “Now!”

Too confused to understand, Malaf let herself be pushed deeper into the shop, squeezing through narrow aisles of floor-to-ceiling shelves. Her shoulders knocked pans off their hooks and sent them clattering to the concrete below. “Shh!” hissed the woman pushing her.

One more hard shove pressed her against the back wall of the shop. By the time Malaf turned around, all she could see was the woman’s back as she returned to the till. The woman – Malaf assumed she was the shop’s owner – had a clear view of the market outside, while Malaf herself was completely hidden as long as she didn’t come any further forward.

Malaf stood blinking under strong halogen lights that made the polished copper pans sparkle, taking deep breaths, willing her heart rate to return to normal. Tried to work out what was going on.

The shopkeeper had resumed working at her till, which Malaf saw was either some sort of stage prop or else broken: the woman was doing calculations by hand on a piece of paper, occasionally making use of an abacus. No customers came in. The woman wrote a figure, then glanced up at the door. Wrote, looked, wrote.

After a few long minutes, when no Guard had come past, the woman seemed to come to a decision. She walked back towards Malaf, holding a long strip of blue cloth.

Frowning, Malaf reached up and touched her hair. She found to her surprise that it was uncovered. At last she understood: she’d lost her headscarf. As usual, it had been draped only loosely around her head and shoulders. In the chase it must have fallen off. And the shopkeeper thought *that* was why they were after her: to arrest her for breaking the decency laws.

“Thank you,” she said quietly, taking the scarf and looping it once around her head.

The woman nodded mutely, then gestured that it was time for her to leave.

---

\noindent Malaf walked with her head down but with eyes scanning the crowd. She hadn’t seen any of the Guard, but that didn’t mean they’d given up the chase. She had to assume they were still out there.

Now Malaf was just another shopper. She had to look the part. She bought a kilo of figs she didn’t need because it give her a plastic bag to carry. Could she put the money in that and ditch the backpack? She considered the idea but rejected it. Better to buy a new backpack if she saw one. Something she could run with.

She passed a stall that sold kites, and with a sudden pang of yearning wondered if Lineh had bought any of hers from here.

Following the currents of the shoppers, Malaf found herself drifting towards Ropeeri Bazaar’s northern entrance. Good: that would be her way out. From there it was only a short distance to the Ropeeri-Teshar metro station, and a train to anywhere that wasn’t here.

She stepped out into the sourceless white light of a sunny, smoggy afternoon. But coming out from underneath the market’s high ceilings didn’t mean she’d really left: all around her people were selling and buying. The smoke from the cooking fires of fast food stalls filled the air. Beggars held out cups, struggling to make their cries heard over the bellowed offers of two-for-one deals on wristwatches, SIM cards, motorcycle helmets. Nearby, beside a small fountain, a group of school-age girls practised doing cartwheels. A feral cat streaked across the street in search of scraps.

This place wasn’t so much a pedestrian area as a road that had given up the fight against jaywalkers. It would have been an act of madness to try to bring a vehicle here.

Which was why the approaching car caused such a commotion.

Malaf heard the complaints of the shoppers before she saw it. The car was unmarked but a blue strobe light had been hastily stuck to its roof in an attempt to clear a path. When the last row of bodies separating it from Malaf had been parted, she could see clearly inside.

It was the Captain.

Left behind by his squad, when reinforcements had arrived he had jumped into one of the cars and made a guess at where Malaf would head if she managed to escape the market. He’d guessed right.

Malaf didn’t turn away in time. The Captain, in the back seat, pointed her out to the others. All four car doors opened at once and people started to get out.

Malaf turned and ran. The entrance to the metro station was in sight.

> **MALAF S:** Is it safe to come out?
>
> **QASEH J:** Yes.
>
> **MALAF S:** Okay.
>
> **QASEH J:** Unless I’ve been arrested and am being coerced into writing this.
>
> **QASEH J:** Gun to my head, etc.
>
> **QASEH J:** So you never know.

Malaf shoved the phone into her jacket pocket, no longer in the mood for games.

She left Lineh’s house through the entrance to the garden, locking the door carefully behind her. It occurred to her that she had never been in this garden. It was communal, shared with the building’s other inhabitants, and therefore not safe territory as far as ever-cautious Lineh was concerned. Best not to be seen together there. Illicit love tradecraft.

When Malaf emerged onto the street she spotted Qaseh on the other side of the road. Qaseh saw her too, and inclined his head towards where they’d parked the car. He started walking that way, and Malaf walked too, shadowing him from across the road.

Malaf was carrying Lineh’s diary in both hands. It looked like she was protecting it, clutching it to her body as if afraid someone might snatch it. But it wasn’t the diary she was protecting: it was the item she’d stashed in the sleeve of her long coat, hard and cool and heavy against her forearm, kept in place by the bend of her wrist. Walking this way she could hide it until she was ready.

When she’d read the most recent diary entry, there hadn’t been any immediate emotional reaction to seeing the letter *Q*. Everything had been very calm. She had decided that she would need to think about its implications carefully in the near future, and had left the bedroom, re-closing the door behind her. From there she stepped into the kitchen, still feeling calm, but with a creeping suspicion that this might be a state of numbness rather than relaxation.

It was only when she’d seen the mortar and pestle that something in her had snapped.

The mortar and pestle were made of marble or something cheaper that looked like it, and the whole ensemble was big and tremendously heavy. It was the kind of thing that, falling from the height of a kitchen counter onto an unprotected foot, would break every single metatarsal and toe and, depending on the specifics of how the building was constructed, might conceivably end up crashing through the floorboards and on into the basement. It was, depending on one’s opinion on how much force it would be reasonable to deploy in grinding herbs and spices, either immensely impractical or simply the only tool for the job.

Malaf had seen Lineh using it only once. In the way memories have of being sometimes exceptionally crisp despite their total lack of consequence, Malaf had what felt like a perfect, high-definition mental video of those few seconds. There was Lineh, grinding away, demolishing a spoonful of cumin seeds. This was how she stood: slightly crooked at the hips, leaning to one side to get the strength of both arms on the pestle. The lines of force curved through her posture, like an illustration in a technical book on figure drawing. She held the pose for a few long moments, until a pot had boiled over behind her; then she turned to look at it, her long hair swishing with the motion.

Just that: those few seconds of unimportant footage, easily forgettable and yet burned into Malaf’s brain, possibly forever, by the inevitable, growing conviction that the woman in the memory was now dead.

Malaf thought about that moment, and about what was written in the diary. Then she picked up the pestle, felt its weight, made a few experimental swings through the air with it, and hid it in her sleeve so Qaseh wouldn’t see it.

Malaf crossed the street when the traffic thinned out enough. The trick was to do it boldly, as if the cars around you did not exist to run you over, or if they did, wouldn’t dare. She stepped into the road without looking, her attention focused solely on Qaseh’s retreating back.

*Q*.

Qaseh wasn’t walking quickly: he was giving Malaf time to catch up. But he hadn’t turned to look at her. He was acting all cool about it, waiting for Malaf to fall into place beside him. Good: it meant Malaf would be able to get close behind him. The back of his head was nicely exposed.

As she approached, she let the heavy marble pestle slide out from her sleeve and into the palm of her hand. It felt comfortable, the way she remembered a gun had felt comfortable from her lessons in school.

Malaf followed Qaseh into the alley where they’d left his car. This place was much quieter than the busy road in front of Lineh’s apartment. Timed right, nobody would see a thing.

There were a few steps left between her and Qaseh. Malaf closed the distance quickly with a couple of long strides and raised the club high.

And then she stopped.

*Yes,* she thought, *but.*

She could hit him, knock him down, get him where she wanted him. She could scream into his ear: *You knew about Lineh, didn’t you? Before we met up again, before I got arrested, you already knew about her, didn’t you?*

But what would it achieve? All Qaseh had to do was deny it. What was she going to do, beat the truth out of him? As appealing as the thought was of doing unto Qaseh’s skull what she’d watched Lineh doing to cumin seeds, it wouldn’t help her here.

And, anyway – now that she’d forced herself to stop and think – did she *know* that Qaseh knew her? All she had was a single letter on a single diary entry. She thought of all the other people she’d met whose name began with a Q. Qopra from her uni days. Qateena from Café Kesh. Even her own father was a Q: Qoshoor Sagheedi.

Shit.

Qaseh turned to face her; she had lowered the pestle just in time. “So,” he asked. “Do you know what happened to your friend now?”

“She went out and didn’t come back,” Malaf said with a shrug. “Took her laptop with her.”

“What’s that you have there?”

“Lineh kept a diary,” Malaf said. “Also, a heavy lump of marble which I was considering hitting you over the head with just now.”

“A diary? Let me see.”

Malaf ignored his outstretched hand. “I’ll read it properly after you’ve taken me home.”

Qaseh shrugged. “*Sure thing, partner,*” he said, in English, with a smile.

This would be a good time, Malaf thought, for a sudden epiphany, one of those perfect *film noir* moments when Qaseh gave himself away, or when she realised he had given himself away earlier. A word he’d used, a fact he’d casually dropped in conversation and which Malaf had ignored because she already knew it, *but how did Qaseh know it?* And then everything would make sense, the stars would align, and she would understand it all.

Instead, she understood nothing. Worse, was so starved for answers that she was seeing patterns in the random noise of another person’s life. So Lineh had written *Q* in her diary. Big deal. People – *real* people – did lots of things no outsider could ever decipher. And, for all its intensity, Malaf’s relationship with Lineh had lasted only a few short weeks. Was Malaf really such an expert in the inner workings of Lineh’s mind that she could ever understand what was written in her diary?

She was so lost in thought she almost didn’t notice they had reached the car. Qaseh, ever the gentleman, was holding the door for her.

---

\noindent The traffic had eased, and they made good time heading back to Malaf’s place. Qaseh was energetic, buoyed up by the night’s work. His criminal acts over the last ten years had certainly put him in a great deal of danger; however, they had mainly consisted of entering codes into a command line, raiding bins outside government offices for documents that hadn’t been properly shredded, and occasionally making a phone call claiming to be the ‘official password inspector’. This had been his first taste of real, physical peril since their drug-smuggling days, and he was itching to talk about it. But Malaf wasn’t playing ball: she just stared out of the window, unresponsive, until they arrived at her street.

“Well,” Qaseh said, with a sigh, “it’s been a blast, Miss Sagheedi. Like old times, eh?”

“No comment.”

“Now, about our little arrangement...”

“I hadn’t forgotten.”

“Your dad’s party is tomorrow.”

“Is there anything in particular you would like me to ask the honourable Mr Hoz, or shall I just quietly assassinate him?”

Qaseh pretended to consider this. “On reflection, I doubt it would really further our interests.” Then he shrugged. “We want to know who his supporters are, so we can investigate them when he runs for President next year. Maybe dig up some dirt on them.”

“How do you know he’ll run?”

“Because he’s said he won’t. How much of a clue do you need? Anyway, just keep an eye on him. Who he talks to, especially who he asks for favours, or who he treats like they owe *him* favours.”

“Doesn’t sound too hard,” Malaf said, opening the door. “All right. Thanks for the ride.”

“Hey!”

Malaf waited.

“It really was fun tonight, Malaf,” Qaseh told her. There was uncharacteristic sincerity in his voice. “We make a good team.”

“Right,” Malaf said.

“The reason I feel the need to stress this,” Qaseh went on, “is that, the day after tomorrow, we – all of us – are going to make a little trip. I might have hinted at it before.”

“What sort of a trip?”

“A camping trip. Two, maybe three days. Into the desert.”

Malaf, thinking of nothing but the diary in her hands, wondered what the best way was of wrapping this all up. “Like the good old days, right?”

“In more ways than you’d think.”

Malaf stared at him.

Qaseh gave her a knowing look. “Yeah,” he said.

“You don’t mean... You’re going back to Ez Nez—”

“Shh,” Qaseh said, looking around. The road was deserted, but he kept his voice down anyway. “But yes. There. *Just* like old times.”

Malaf couldn’t believe it. “*Smuggling?*”

“Oh please, I think we can all agree that was just an adolescent fad we were going through.” Qaseh grinned at her. “No, this is something else. Information gathering. Confirming what was written in the documents. I can’t tell you more about it yet, but I’ve spoken to the others, and we all really want you to come with us. Interested?”

“Not even remotely.”

Qaseh shrugged. “Well, the seat’s reserved for you, right up to when we leave. Who knows? You might change your mind.”

“I strongly doubt it.” Malaf turned, ready to leave, then hesitated. Thinking she might as well try, she asked: “Did you already know who Lineh was before I mentioned her to you?”

“What? No,” he said, apparently baffled by the sudden change in direction. “Why would I?”

“It doesn’t matter,” she said, and walked away. Qaseh started to ask her a question but she ignored it.

---

\noindent In her apartment, Malaf went to the kitchen and put the samovar on. She let the tea brew nice and strong before pouring her first glass: it was going to be a long night.

Sitting at her desk, she moved aside a stack of printouts from her latest translation project – for which, she reminded herself, she would need to get a deadline extension, since she had done literally nothing to it since the night of her arrest. She set the diary in the centre of a clear space and pulled her lamp over. Apart from this circle of bright white light, the room remained in darkness.

Just as she was about to start reading, she noticed the LED on her answering machine was blinking. Next to it, a little LCD screen gave the details of the call. It came from a landline in the south of the country, in the city of Ez Takhab.

She stared blankly at the number. She had never been to Ez Takhab. If asked why not, she would have struggled to answer. It had simply never come up. As was traditional for born-and-bred Ez Raamers, the idea of wanting to spend one’s time in other, *lesser* cities seemed faintly ludicrous to Malaf. In their uni days, Irooj, who was from Ez Takhab, would often take exception to this attitude, and would enumerate all the ways Ramestan’s second city did more than just hold its own against the nation’s capital, whether in art, architecture, cuisine, climate or music. Malaf had enjoyed these discussions. They amused her.

She grabbed a scrap of paper and a pen, which she started twirling idly around her fingers as she thought. Ez Takhab? The only dealings she’d had with anyone from there had been when she’d called...

Her eyes widened. *Khesri.*

She played back the message.

“Miss Sagheedi. This is Ros Khesri. You called me yesterday. I... uh.”

Malaf smiled. Clearly the professor did not like answering machines.

“Well, it’s like you said: your name is in the phonebook. Translator. Uh...” Muffled sounds: the geologist juggling his phone around to look at his watch. “It’s about... well, it’s late. I’m not happy about you lying to me about working for RaamCo, so I almost didn’t call you. But you mentioned Lineh Parkiesh. You said that she’d disappeared. Well, I think I might know something about that.”

Malaf nearly dropped the pen.

“I told you I didn’t know the name, but that’s not true,” Khesri’s voice was saying. “She called me once, from RaamCo. She wanted to know about... well, I won’t go into that. Not over the phone. I flew to Ez Raam as soon as I could, spent the night in a hotel. You want to know why I visited RaamCo? Well, that’s why.”

Malaf stared at the answering machine, wanting to shake it. *What’s* why?

“Anyway... we should talk, maybe. Call me when you get this. You know my number, of course. Um.”

A beep signalled the end of the call.

Malaf looked at the clock. It was far too late to call, but she’d already established a reputation for rudeness and had nothing to lose. She hit redial. She noticed that the dictaphone was still plugged in from their last session, and pressed record.

She listened to the phone ringing for more than five minutes before giving up. Either he was asleep, or had been woken up but was refusing to answer – which, she appreciated, did not bode well for the thawing of their working relationship.

Malaf put the phone down, making a note to call him first thing in the morning. Then, feeling that she couldn’t put it off any longer, she opened Lineh’s diary, and began to read.

She started from the beginning. There were a lot of blank pages, and those with writing on them were mostly lists of words with only occasional complete sentences. Malaf read slowly, pausing after every entry to make herself think through the implications of each word. After the first few weeks, she began taking notes.

She filed her observations into tidy columns, each with its own heading. And, gradually, among the shopping lists and everyday odd jobs, words and phrases began to recur. Signals emerged from the noise: the stories whose interweaving made up a life.

There were the mentions of Café Kesh, recurring each Sunday. Before that, not just on Sundays, the phrase *do French*. Malaf knew Lineh had tried teaching herself using an app on her phone, with little success, before learning from Maara about the language club.

Lineh had gone to a few sessions before she and Malaf had started speaking. That was where the Café Kesh story faded, and became the story of *M.* Their days and nights together were recorded with only occasional supplementary details.

*M — xiàngqí.*

*M — coffee.*

*M — park.*

*M.*

Their last evening together, the night of their final argument: *M?*

And that marked the end of that story.

A few days after that: *Q*, a single, unexplained, perhaps unexplainable entry. Malaf underlined that, added a question mark, and moved on.

Then she looked again at the other column she’d drawn up.

Lineh’s diary entries were lists of, typically, one or two words per line. She had written complete sentences rarely enough for them to stand out when they did appear, and Malaf had started collecting those. It wasn’t long before a unifying theme began to emerge.

She read them again. The earliest reference was from before she and Malaf had met:

*Went for coffee with Mr Starfish. Couldn’t get out of it this time, but it wasn’t too painful. Maybe that’ll satisfy him.*

That odd nickname: *Mr Starfish*. Lineh had told Maara, but had never said a word to Malaf. Again, that emotional distance. It stung. Had they ever *really* known each other?

That weekend:

*After shopping came home and found a delivery of flowers waiting for me. No name, but knew it had to be him. He texted later, said they were a thank you for the coffee. Should have known this would happen.*

Later, at irregular intervals over the weeks that followed:

*Starfish sent me cinema tickets. Sent them back.*

*He sent me nine texts today.*

*I called Starfish today, told him to stop. He wouldn’t listen. Said he loves me whatever I say.*

*M.*

Malaf stared at that last entry with her head in her hands. She felt something pounding against the inside of her skull, a pressure build-up that might crack her open. This had been unfolding *even while they were dating.* And Malaf had had no idea. Why hadn’t Lineh told her?

And then Lineh and Malaf had split up. A week passed. And then there was this:

*In the morning before work I swear I saw his car parked outside my house. Like he was waiting for me to wake up.*

*I should have confronted him, made a big scene, but I couldn’t face it. Went out through the back door instead.*

*Should I call police? But what would they do?*

*I don’t know what to do.*

It was the last entry in the diary.

## II

There was a set of possible worlds in which Malaf made it in time. She had run faster, or had seen the danger earlier, or maybe hadn’t gone for a walk and was already there when Ressi and Payim arrived. Malaf would never know in how many of those worlds Boraz had survived; in how many her presence at the campsite had been enough to save him. Probably they were outnumbered by those in which they both died, gunned down without ceremony by the men in the van.

As it happened, this world was the world in which Malaf wasn’t even close to the action when the first of them died.

Echoes made the gunshot come from everywhere at once. Malaf faltered in her sprint, nearly falling. She crashed into a lamppost that by some miracle was still standing, then clung to it as her knees buckled and her lungs sucked desperately for air.

Who *were* they? What were they doing out here?

She felt suddenly very exposed out on the street. There was a dark gap between two shops on the other side of the road. She forced down one more gulp of air and pushed off from the lamppost, lurching across the road.

---

\noindent Ressi stood over the body of the man he’d just killed. He stepped carefully around the spray of blood and tissue streaking out like an angry exclamation mark from what was left of the man’s head, and started going through his pockets. He found nothing exciting. A low-end smartphone, useless out here in the desert. A wallet with not much cash. Credit cards in the name of Boraz Feroosh. A set of car keys.

Ressi got to his feet, brushed dirt off his trousers, then went over to Payim. “That went well,” he said cheerfully, tossing the keys to Payim, who caught them with difficulty. “I really am feeling extremely positive about all this.”

Payim said nothing. Ressi noticed he was shaking slightly. “Oh, will you not just *lighten up?* And keep a lookout, all right?”

Payim nodded, still saying nothing, and Ressi turned his attention to the campers’ car. Its doors were all unlocked, the boot open. Ressi had a good poke around in the boot, shoving things around.

“I see sleeping bags,” he called to Payim. “Four of them. Check the tent.”

“Two more in here,” Payim shouted back after a moment. His voice was tight with sudden fear. “Ressi, nobody told us there would be *six* of them.”

“Cheer up, it’s only five now!”

“Ressi, this isn’t funny. They must have heard that shot. *They know we’re here.*”

Ressi unbent from his study of the contents of the car’s boot. He turned to Payim. “This thing seats four – five if they want to get really cosy. But there are six sleeping bags. You know what that means?”

Payim nodded slowly.

“They have another car.”

---

\noindent Darting from one shadow to the next, Malaf made her way down the street. As she drew closer to the football field where they’d set up camp, she realised she could hear men’s voices. Two of them.

From where she was hiding, she knew that if she crossed the road and peered over the edge of the building ahead of her she would be able to see the campsite.

Ducking down low, she moved quickly and silently. She got to the wall just in time to hear a car door slam. A moment later an engine started. She heard the crunch of tyres turning slowly over grit, moving no faster than a person could walk.

Malaf flattened herself against the brickwork. She was out in the open. Which way would the van come? If it did a U-turn and went back the way it came, its driver would surely see her.

But the noises receded. They were going the other way.

Malaf took a chance and poked her head around the wall. She had just enough time to see the back end of the van turn a corner between two buildings and disappear.

A heartbeat later she saw the body.

She ran from her hiding place without checking if the coast was clear. From the clothes she knew it was Boraz. The way he was lying, it wasn’t until she got close that she could see the mess the bullet had made of his face.

She opened her mouth to take the breath that would become the scream, then wrestled it back down. The men who did this might still be near enough to hear her. She had to take control. She had to think.

She wrenched her gaze away from Boraz’s body and looked around. Where the hell were Qaseh and Abeej? Could she warn them? It seemed, for the moment, that she couldn’t. She would have to assume they had heard the gunshots too and were taking care of themselves. That was their job. What was hers?

Step one: get away from the campsite.

Step two: hide.

She looked back at Qaseh’s big car. She could see through its open door that the key was not in the ignition. Probably those psychos had taken it, trapping them here. Who *were* they? *What was going on?*

She took one more look around herself to see if the coast was clear, then jogged over to the car.

Step zero: she had to find the gun.

---

\noindent Payim drove slowly, inching the van around potholes and impact craters. They hadn’t got very far from the campsite when Ressi told him to stop.

“What is it?” Payim hissed. “Do you see them?”

Ressi opened the van’s door without answering. Payim swore under his breath and followed.

Ressi walked quickly away from the van, coming around behind it. Then he squatted in the middle of the road, frowning at something he’d seen lying on the cracked tarmac. He picked it up carefully between thumb and forefinger, inspected it: a small brass cylinder.

Payim recognised it immediately. It was a bullet casing.

Ressi turned it between his fingers. Under the harsh sunlight it shone brightly. He sniffed at it. This thing wasn’t a relic of the war. This had been fired recently.

There were dozens of them.

Ressi looked at the casing, then up at Payim, then back at the casing again.

“What does it mean, Ressi?” Payim asked.

“I means they’re armed, brother,” Ressi said quietly.

And then, to Payim’s horror, he smiled, as if only now he was beginning to enjoy himself.

---

\noindent Malaf worked quickly, hands shaking, knowing that every second she spent here was more dangerous than the second preceding it.

She pulled the long canvas bags of the tents out of the car boot, dumped them on the ground. The butane stove made a metallic clang as it landed next to them. Next came the backpacks, all four of them, each desperately heavy. Bags of rubbish, food containers. The sloshing cans of water. Her arms burned with the effort.

Puffing with exhaustion, she finally got the last of it out. Underneath was a thin partition covering a storage space below. She dug her fingers into the hole and pulled that up and out, tossed it away.

In the storage compartment: a spare tyre, a jack, a can of antifreeze, and several boxes of ammunition.

But no gun.

Malaf swore. She sank down to the floor, closed her eyes miserably.

*It’s not here,* she told herself. *Maybe it travelled in the other car. You’re wasting your time here. You need to go.*

Then she took a deep breath and, ignoring her own advice, started on the backpacks.

Hers she didn’t bother with: she knew it wouldn’t be in there. Qaseh’s was the most likely. She opened that up and started to empty it. She pulled out a book on system administration, a pair of binoculars, the GPS receiver. Clothes. Various unidentifiable bits of electronics. A fat folder stuffed with Mr Obid’s leaked documents.

No gun.

Okay: Abeej’s bag next.

She was reaching out for it when a scream made her leap to her feet. No, she realised a moment later, not a scream: it was the shrill bleat of the two-way radio calling for attention.

Malaf raced to the car’s passenger door and yanked it open. The radio was sitting on the seat. She picked up the device so quickly that she nearly dropped it.

“—there?”

It was a woman’s voice, muffled by static and engine noise. She was driving, or being driven.

“Irooj,” Malaf hissed, hoping she was pressing the right button for transmission. “Where are you?”

“Oh! Malaf! Hey, girlfriend,” Irooj said cheerfully. “Listen, we’re just getting into town now, and we wanted to know if you’re—”

“Listen to me,” Malaf cut in. “We’re in danger. Boraz is dead.”

“Say that again?”

“There are men here with guns. They came here just now. They’re driving a white van. Two of them, I think. They killed Boraz.”

“You’ve got a funny way of being funny.”

“I’m not joking! They shot him in the head. Irooj, you have to be careful. They’re still out there. I think they’re looking for the rest of us. They’re here to kill us all.”

Malaf heard Tusham saying something in the background. Irooj replied indistinctly, her hand muffling the microphone.

“Hello? Irooj! Talk to me. Please!”

At last Irooj replied: “Where are you now?”

“At the campsite.”

“Abeej? Qaseh?”

“I don’t know where they’ve gone. Listen to me, you have to stay—”

Noises from the other side interrupted her; then nothing but static. Malaf listened, pressing her ear to the radio’s hard plastic.

A second later she heard, not through the radio, but carried over the open air, the sound of distant gunfire.

---

\noindent The first bullet punched a hole in the Sixty’s windscreen, dragging with it through the passenger compartment a supersonic halo of tiny shards of jagged glass. It tore a chunk of yellow foam from the driver’s side headrest, then exited through the rear window which, probably owing to some pre-existing small fracture that Irooj hadn’t had fixed, shattered completely into opaque whiteness. If Irooj had been sitting normally, it would surely have killed her instantly.

As it happened, Malaf’s warning over the radio, frantic and at that point only half-believed, had heightened her awareness enough to buy her a fraction of a second in reaction time. So when Ressi stepped into the path of her car with his arms raised in a shooting stance, both she and Tusham ducked down in their seats quickly enough to save their lives. The second, third and fourth shots also passed over their heads, tearing the car’s windscreen to shreds.

Irooj cried out in shock. Folded up with her head down in the driver’s seat, she couldn’t see where she was going. But one thing was obvious to her: if the car stopped moving, they were dead meat.

And so, driving blind, she stamped on the accelerator.

Ressi had known his aim had been solid, and he was expecting the car to stop. Instead the Sixty surged forward. Irooj barely had any control of the steering wheel, and the car swayed from left to right and back again, its engine whining as it gained speed.

The distance between Ressi and the car shrank alarmingly rapidly. Changing plans, Ressi made a dash to one side. It was the wrong choice: the wall he had flattened himself against was the one the car was hurtling towards.

He almost didn’t make it, and might easily have been crushed. But at the last moment the car swerved. Its tail swung out, close enough for him to touch it. An instant later the Sixty was already past him, lurching from one side of the road to the other.

Ressi spun around and raised his gun. He fired a couple more shots at the retreating vehicle. One went over its roof. Another blew out one of its brake lights.

The car continued crazily down the street. Before long it was beyond the range where Ressi could reliably hit it. If Irooj had been able to see where she was going she would have steered it around a bend and out of harm’s way. Instead she drove it into a wall.

The car’s front clipped the corner of a crumbling building. The collision kicked up a spray of masonry and dust, and spun the car to a violent stop sideways in the road.

The car hadn’t been going very fast – there had been no time to change gear – but neither Irooj nor Tusham had been wearing a seat belt, and the impact was enough to hurl them forward out of their seats. Bruised, dazed, they fought to untangle themselves and find a way to open the car doors.

Ressi watched the collision from some distance away. Nearby he could hear Payim: he had been crouched by their van when they had heard the whine of the Sixty’s engine. Now Ressi yelled at him, waving him over. Payim understood: this was their best chance to finish them off. He joined his brother running towards the crashed car.

---

\noindent Malaf ran without a plan, without knowing where she was going except towards the gunfire, into danger. As she ran she bent down to scoop up a fist-sized lump of rubble, thinking she might need something to hit someone with, or throw. It was better than nothing. To free up her other hand she clipped the radio to her belt – it was too big for her pocket. Her shaking hands cost her valuable seconds. She wanted to scream.

The sound of the car crash told her where she had to run.

A building up in front had collapsed almost completely. It slouched across the road in a tangle of metal bars and concrete, all of it the same dusty grey. The wreckage blocked her path, but the rubble made a pile that looked easy enough to climb over. As fast as she could she stepped onto the most solid-looking part of it.

She ascended for a few seconds, testing her weight at every step. Out here a twisted ankle could kill.

Gradually she got up on top of the heap. From where she stood she could see the length of the street.

To one side sat the crashed Sixty. Its passenger door opened. Malaf saw Tusham’s head poking out, taking a look around before suddenly jerking back in.

Malaf turned, and saw what he had seen: two men running towards the car.

---

\noindent Payim and Ressi were halfway to the crashed car when they heard a noise to one side. They turned to look, and simultaneously skidded to a halt.

A figure had climbed on top of the wreckage of a broken building. A woman. She stood there unsteadily, knowing that she stood on rubble that could slide out from beneath her feet at any second.

The sun was behind her, which made it hard for them to see her face. But there wasn’t any doubt who she was.

They stared at her stupidly for a long moment.

Then, with a cheery wave, Ressi called her name.

“Miss Sagheedi!” he yelled, aiming his gun at her. “It’s so nice to meet you at last!”

---

\noindent Malaf saw the gun go up, heard the shot. It was all over in less than a second.

Fear and adrenaline had driven her reactions to probably faster than they had ever been in her life. Millions of accumulated years of evolutionarily preprogrammed fight-or-flight instinct were rushing to her aid. She had the upper ground, perfect visibility, and an absolutely unambiguous understanding of her opponents’ intentions. She was psychologically primed and ready for anything.

And none of it mattered. Before she had even flinched, the shot had been fired. By the time her nervous system had initiated the motor processes involved in throwing herself down onto the pile of rubble, the danger was already an almost embarrassing number of milliseconds in the past, and the realisation that her actions had had no bearing whatsoever on whether she lived or died had barely begun to form in her sluggish, animal brain.

She dropped to her hands and knees, and looked up at Payim and Ressi. What she saw puzzled her: they, too, had ducked.

Because they hadn’t been the ones who’d fired the shot.

Now Ressi and Payim were running in Malaf’s direction, not because they were still trying to kill her, but because that was the shortest route to something they could hide behind.

Another shot fired. Malaf flattened herself down as much as she could, presenting as small a cross-section as possible to any stray bullets. From that position she pivoted her head around to see what was happening.

To her right, the doors of the crashed Sixty had both opened. She caught a glimpse of Tusham pulling Irooj away to safety. It looked like she was putting up a fight, trying to rescue something from the vehicle, perhaps the two-way radio. Tusham practically had to lift her off her feet and carry her away.

Straight ahead of her, Malaf could now see movement. Two heads taking turns to poke up over a low wall. She couldn’t see them clearly, but they could only be Abeej and Qaseh. And they had the gun: she saw one of them, Abeej she guessed, extend his arms in a two-handed grip, taking aim. But at the last minute he decided not to fire, and ducked back behind the wall. The boxes of ammunition had all been in the car, Malaf recalled: they had to be careful with their shots.

Meanwhile, Ressi and Payim had retreated to a bombed-out shop very near where she was lying. She lost sight of them, but after a few seconds heard another couple of gunshots from nearby. They must have found a position to shoot back from. Abeej and Qaseh’s heads vanished as they ducked down behind their wall. When she lost sight of them too, she felt suddenly very alone, and dangerously exposed.

Malaf waited, hearing nothing but her own heartbeat.

*How the fuck did they know her name?*

But of course, she knew the answer to that. It was why she’d had to leave Ez Raam in the first place.

She wondered what she should do next.

In terms of straight line distance, she was probably very close to the men who’d killed Boraz. They knew who she was, and where she was, and they were here for her. They were tied up now with Abeej and Qaseh taking potshots at them from across the road, but neither of them had fired in a while and it wouldn’t take long for Ressi and Payim to work out there were only a couple more bullets left in the gun and come looking for her.

If she was going to move, it would have to be *now*.

She pushed herself up to her hands and knees. She would inch her way backwards down the rubble pile, keeping low in case the shooting started again. Then, when she was on back on solid ground, she would get away from here and try to meet up with Tusham and Irooj.

She looked behind her.

That was when she realised that Ressi and Payim had retreated into the bombed-out shop through its front door; and then, after firing a couple of rounds through the window at Qaseh and Abeej and hitting nothing, they had abandoned that position and looked for a back entrance. Malaf turned just as Payim emerged blinking into the sunlight.

He saw her and raised his gun, but Malaf was already moving.

She leapt to her feet and sprinted forwards, feet sliding over the loose rubble. By the time he fired, Malaf was over the crest of it and slipping down the other side, arms outstretched and wheeling to keep her balance.

She hit the pavement on the other side at a run, and kept going.

---

\noindent Payim stumbled as he came off the rubble heap, falling to one knee onto the hard ground. He gritted his teeth through the explosion of pain, then looked up. The Sagheedi woman was quick: in those few seconds she’d already put a lot of distance between them.

Still in a kneeling position, he held his gun two-handed, taking careful aim. But he knew he wasn’t as good a shot as his brother, not at this distance, certainly not at a moving target. With a cry of frustration he got to his feet and started to chase her.

That was when Abeej broke cover.

---

\noindent Abeej had been with Qaseh. The men had been moving to find a better firing position. They crawled on their bellies to stay covered by their stretch of wall, which at points had crumbled to less than waist-height. But they had soon realised that they had nowhere else to go: to get to anywhere safer, they would have to emerge into the open street.

Qaseh and Abeej had been trying to communicate a strategy with frantic gestures when they realised Malaf and Payim were close by.

Abeej was holding the gun.

He looked at Qaseh, who shook his head urgently. *No.*

Ignoring him, Abeej poked his head over the wall. He saw Payim running past and figured he would have no better chance. He stood up faster than Qaseh could react to pull him back down. In one smooth movement he vaulted the wall.

He thought he might be able to shoot Payim in the back, but the man heard the noise and turned, eyes widening in shock.

Abeej raised the gun and fired, but by the time he’d squeezed the trigger Payim had leapt aside. Abeej’s bullet kicked up a spray of dust from the brickwork of a nearby building.

Malaf, a distant figure by now, had made it to a narrow alley she could escape through. She had just got off the main street when she heard the gunshot, and despite the danger, she put her head around the wall to see what had happened.

She was just in time to see Payim fire back.

The speed of sound in air as hot as that day in Ez Nezeshti is around three hundred and fifty metres per second. Malaf wasn’t far enough away for that to matter. But she would have sworn that between the spasm that shook Abeej, and the sound of Payim’s gun reaching her ears, there was a span of time that could be measured in heartbeats.

She was sure she had time to whisper: “Please no...”

Abeej sank to his knees, his shirt already red with blood. He tried to lift his own gun, but Payim was too quick, firing again and again. She heard Payim emit a shrill, inchoate scream of anger and exhilaration as he emptied his magazine into her friend’s now lifeless body.

Temporarily forgotten, Malaf watched through the tears for as long as she dared. She watched as Payim just stood there, panting with exertion, starting down at Abeej. A few moments later Ressi arrived on the scene and collected Abeej’s gun, weighing it in his hand with an appreciative look. He gave it to Payim with great solemnity, as if it were a trophy.

Knowing there was nothing more she could do, Malaf ducked deeper into the shadows of the alley and disappeared.

## III


The way into the underground Ropeeri-Teshar metro station wasn’t much to look at: a bank of lifts and escalators enclosed in a small structure of grit-scratched perspex that kept the snow off during winter. Hanging on one wall, a large computer screen showed platforms and departure times. Malaf tried to catch a look at this as she sprinted through the open doors. The Ez Akri Martyrs Line, Platform 2 Westbound: four minutes.

The Captain and his three Guards were close behind her and gaining rapidly. That train would be her only chance.

Commuters eagerly awaiting the Ropeeri-Teshar experience faced a choice: the stairs or the escalator. The station was pretty deep underground, but the escalator was so creaky and slow that all but the most infirm chose the stairs.

Malaf took the escalator.

In fact, she took the *up* escalator, running awkwardly against its direction of movement.

She was lucky: the escalator was empty apart from her. Her feet thudded hollowly on the metal steps as the daylight dwindled behind her. The video screens decorating the walls of the tunnel would normally be a psychedelic display of adverts. Now, in this time of crisis, they all showed the same image: the face of the Supreme Leader. PRAY FOR HIM, the captions read.

“Stop!” a Guard shouted from the top of the tunnel. Malaf could feel through her feet the thumps as they leapt onto the escalator, taking the too-big steps many at a time. They too were on the up-escalator: in their high speed chase there had been no time to think about it.

Malaf made it to the bottom, jumping the last few steps in a move that sent a jolt of pain through her ankle. Choking back the scream, she spun around and looked up the tunnel.

Higher up on the escalators she saw the Guards descending: the Captain at the rear, two others ahead of him. The fourth must have stayed at the top where his radio would still get a signal.

“Stop!” one of them yelled again.

*My thoughts exactly,* Malaf said to herself, and she slapped her hand against the little red button on the wall of the tunnel, a button marked EMERGENCY USE ONLY.

An alarm bell began ringing shrilly, and with a scream of grinding metal the escalator jerked to a sudden halt. A fraction of a second later, three men running at full speed the wrong way on an escalator simultaneously tried to land their feet on a stair that wasn’t there.

Two of them managed to keep their balance, but one did not, and that was enough. In a slapstick tangle of flailing arms and legs, all three of them were pitched forward into the air and sent tumbling face-first down the stairway. They landed wedged sideways between the waist-high walls of the escalator. By the time one of them had managed to work out which way he was pointed and began groping his way upright, Malaf had disappeared into the underground station.

---

\noindent Like most of the public loudspeakers in Ez Raam, the ones in Ropeeri-Teshar metro station were ancient and barely functional. At the time for the call to prayer, many of them didn’t emit any sound other than a low buzz. The ones that did work could only do so much with the material they were given: magnetic tapes played and rewound until worn threadbare. They tried to make up for it with volume, but that only distorted the words even further. The sounds ultimately issuing from the speakers were barely recognisable as speech, let alone a call to prayer.

None of the people in the metro station reacted when the call began, except perhaps to look at their watches and be amazed at how time was flying. Those who were inclined to pray would wait until they were back on ground level, where there was space. Either way, the sound was such a normal part of the background Ez Raami soundscape that its presence changed nothing, except to help mask the noises Malaf made as she ran past.

Ropeeri-Teshar metro station started below ground level and went only deeper. In the war years, with the train service suspended, its tunnels had been a bomb shelter for thousands. The thought of an entrance caving in and trapping those people was enough to give anyone nightmares. The air-con units were badly in need of maintenance, and despite their constant high whine they didn’t even make a dent on the thick smog of particulates emitted by the trains passing below. Bright lights threw well-defined beams through the fog like a laser display at a concert, and on some of the longer platforms, you could stand at one end and not see a friend waiting at the other. It took a lot to make an Ez Raamer want to go *outside* for a breath of fresh air, but somehow Ropeeri-Teshar made it happen.

Malaf knew this place so well she could get through it in the dark – which, she supposed, might come in useful, given the city’s frequent brownouts. She took a left turn into the tunnel marked *Ez Akri Martyrs.*

Named after one of the bloodiest battles of the war, the Ez Akri Martyrs Line was a green S-shape on the Ez Raami metro map. It took commuters from Ropeeri-Teshar to Four Gardens, past super-chic Irijil Square, onwards through the museum quarter, and all stops between there and the Volunteer Army Martyrs’ Cemetery. But Malaf didn’t care where it led *to.* All she needed was a *from.*

As she went around a bend in the tunnel she realised there were several tough-looking men up ahead, running straight for her. They were wearing the uniform of the Transport Police. They were armed.

There was nowhere she could go to escape. Fighting every instinct to flee, Malaf slowed down, forced her body into a normal walking gait. She kept her head down and didn’t flinch as the men brushed past her.

She’d guessed right: they hadn’t even noticed her. It probably hadn’t hurt that like an idiot she was still carrying the bag of figs she’d bought at the market.

The men were responding to the stopped escalator. They knew people had been injured but hadn’t had time to review the footage of what had caused it.

They didn’t know that they should be looking for her – yet.

Malaf picked up the pace, hovering just below a run. She climbed a set of stairs, turned a corner, then at last emerged into open space.

In better days, when big construction works were more affordable, underground metro platforms had all been this grand. The platform was long and wide, set into a cylindrical space whose curved walls were decorated with religious calligraphy. Bright ceiling lights were ringed with haloes of smog. The same fuzziness made it hard to make out the messages on the LED displays. Ez Akri Martyrs Line (Westbound). Next train: one minute.

It was going to be a long sixty seconds.

There were a handful of others on the platform, some of them standing so far away that their bodies were hard to make out in the haze. A janitor swept away ticket stubs and cigarette butts with a long wooden broom. Malaf turned her back on them all, afraid of meeting their eyes. After so much running it took an almost superhuman effort just to stand still and wait.

A stale wind began to blow through the metro station, tugging at her headscarf. She stared into the depths of the tunnel ahead of her, watching it gradually grow bright. With a squeal of metal on metal the train burst from the tunnel and began to slow down. Before long it was at walking speed. Its doors wouldn’t open until it had come to a complete halt. Malaf found a door she liked and sidestepped to keep pace with it.

*They’re right behind me,* Malaf told herself.

A scene played out in her imagination as a fast-cut montage, compressing the last few minutes off-screen into an action-packed montage. The transport cops had reached the stopped escalator. They’d expected to find an old lady who’d tripped, or a gang of teens who’d been goofing around. Instead they’d found three furious, injured Guards. One of them was even a Captain. The Captain screamed orders at them, and for a few moments they were too shocked to do anything more than stare blankly at him. Then, at last, the quickest of them went to find an emergency telephone.

The metro train finally shuddered to a standstill. A few long seconds later its doors opened, and a tide of people poured through the gap. It would have been impossible for someone standing on the platform to force her way in. She would have to wait.

Meanwhile, in the station’s central office, a red telephone rang. An official picked it up and listened to the news from the scene at escalator. The Guards were hunting someone. A woman in her thirties. Long brown coat, blue headscarf. Stop her at all costs.

CCTV footage was quickly brought up on a bank of monitors. Somebody spotted her right away standing on Platform 2 Westbound. They got a clear look at her face before the passenger doors opened and a crowd of businessmen flooded out, blocking their view.

A man was already sending orders: get there *now.*

Four armed transport cops were on the platform thirty seconds later. They were just in time to see the train disappear into the tunnel. The most senior of them swore loudly, and picked up the nearest emergency telephone.

---

\noindent The next station on the Ez Akri Martyrs Line was Four Gardens. Arguably one of the grandest and most recognisable buildings in Ez Raam – painstakingly rebuilt from the original blueprints after the war left it in ruins – it was the main metro station serving the beating political heart of Ramestan. Not only was it only a short walk from there to the Ramestani Parliament: it was also where one got off if one wanted to drop in on the Supreme Leader in his palace, or visit the offices of the Army, Ez Raami Police, or the always-welcoming Guards.

It was safe to say that there was no greater concentration of twitchily alert young men with sniper rifles and machine guns in the entire country; the quarter-mile as a whole probably ranked in the global top twenty, excluding active war zones. Similarly, if one had to rank the world’s metro stations in order of the chances of slipping out unobserved after the alert had been raised and a description had been radioed to the relevant authorities *who even knew in advance which train you were going to be arriving on*, Four Gardens would come in somewhere near the bottom.

The transport cops at Four Gardens hadn’t been given much of a warning, but it was more than enough.

By the time the metro train pulled into the station, the platform was crammed with armed officers. Before it had actually stopped moving they yanked open the door to the driver’s compartment. The startled-looking train driver was pulled bodily away from his controls, to be replaced with a junior officer who knew the procedure for locking all the passenger doors and killing the engine.

After the ever-present noise of the motors died, the platform was eerily silent. The police didn’t know the reason for the stoppage. Their orders were simply to hold the train at the platform and wait, without entering, until a Guard representative arrived. Under no circumstances was anyone to be let out. The officer in charge knew the stoppage would cause chaos across the Ez Raami public transport network, and that every minute was costing the city a fortune. But he also knew what happened to people who disobeyed Guard orders.

As soon as they realised something unusual was going on, the passengers braced themselves for an inspection, possibly even a bag search. Women adjusted their clothing, doing up buttons, lowering their headscarves to cover more hair. Unmarried couples quietly split up, men and women migrating to opposite ends of the carriages. Some turned around in their seats and peered through windows, unable to look away from the black metal of the men’s guns. Others responded with fury: how dare they keep them locked up like this? Most pretended not to notice that there was anything amiss at all, and simply stayed where they were, keeping their heads down and praying that nothing they had done or might accidentally do later would call attention to themselves.

Malaf did not do any of these things.

This was because she wasn’t on the train.

At the exact moment when the Captain’s car pulled up outside Four Gardens metro station and he emerged, gun drawn, ready to go down and arrest her, Malaf decided that enough time had passed for her to risk stepping out of the janitors’ closet she’d seen unlocked on Platform 2 Westbound of Ropeeri-Teshar.

She had spotted it just as the metro train had come to a stop, and the crowd of people getting off the train had given her a few seconds to make her move. She had pulled the door shut behind her and crouched, in disinfectant-smelling darkness, her back pressed against a hard metal shelf stocked with cleaning chemicals.

When she opened the door again, the platform was deserted. No passengers, and no cops. The chase had moved elsewhere. The only figure she could make out was the janitor off in the smoggy distance.

He’d seen her. There was no way he couldn’t have. But he kept his head turned away, focussing on his work, studiously blind and deaf to her presence. Malaf guessed he was an illegal immigrant; probably he didn’t speak much Rami. The last thing he wanted was a conversation with the law. He wouldn’t bother her if she didn’t bother him.

She darted from the janitors’ closet to the platform exit. She would have been in the CCTV camera’s sight for only a few seconds. She just had to pray that they were the *right* seconds: that everyone was too busy redirecting trains, or following the chase in Four Gardens, to be looking at the security screens.

She made it to the ticketing hall without setting off any alarms. Once there she joined the biggest crowd she could find and let them carry her towards the nearest escalator.

A few minutes later the escalator reached ground level. Dull white daylight shone onto her, almost blinding, as Malaf emerged into something approaching freedom.

\noindent In a large, well-lit oak-panelled office, two attendants exchanged glances, mentally drawing straws. The one still holding the phone gave her colleague a look suggesting it was *her* turn. The other, who had merely been listening in, held up a hand, signalling, *It’s your bad news. You deliver it.*

The woman with the phone, whose name was Isaha, nodded in resignation, and got to her feet, smoothing the fabric of her long black gown carefully. Her co-worker looked her up and down, pointing out a hair that needed to be tucked out of sight. Paired spot-checks like this were useful in a place where mirrors, and other magnets of vanity, were forbidden.

Isaha left the main communications office – quaintly referred to as the ‘telephone room’, which said a lot about her employer’s relationship with modern technology – and went upstairs.

The door she stood in front of was shut. She knocked loudly: her boss had no patience for timidity in his employees. Possibly it had something to do with the fact that, for almost his entire adult life, most of the people he met had been terrified of him.

Behind the door, Imam Boraqashti had just finished his prayers and was rolling up his prayer mat.

The office was tiny and windowless, lit by a single too-bright bulb, and unadorned except for a portrait of the Supreme Leader. It was hard to reconcile the size of the office with the reputation of the man inside it. The prayer mat needed to be tidied away when it was not in use because when it was unrolled there was nowhere else to stand. In an official residence most people would call a palace, one of Ramestan’s most powerful clerics – a man hotly tipped to be the Supreme Leader’s successor if the unthinkable happened – had elected to work in a broom closet.

Boraqashti looked up at Isaha and froze. A long moment of inexplicable awkwardness passed between them, almost as if Isaha had walked in on him naked. Despite having a number of women working for him, the old man was clearly uncomfortable in their presence, as if frightened of their witching ways.

“Speak,” he commanded after a few moments, his voice an irritated rasp. Then he hesitated, apparently fearing the worst. “Is it... has he...?”

Isaha shook her head quickly. “It’s not about the Supreme Leader, sir.”

Boraqashti nodded, relieved. “Praise God,” he mumbled. Then, more loudly, “So?”

“They have lost Ms Sagheedi’s trail,” Isaha said, quickly and clearly. Better to rip the plaster off quickly. “The head of the investigation has apologised, and wants to assure you that both he and—”

Boraqashti waved her silent without looking at her. He turned abruptly away, and bent over his desk, apparently studying the documents laid out there. Isaha wondered if he really was reading them, however. When he did things like this, she got the impression that he was putting on an act. He was doing something that made him look thoughtful and in control, while inside he was reeling, panicked, lost. It was yet another coping mechanism that this cripplingly shy man had taught himself to use in order to function normally. The fact that he did it in front of even his most junior employees was almost tragic. Isaha might have felt pity for this old man if she could have forgotten how many death warrants bore his signature.

After a long pause, the Imam looked up at her briefly, blinking through the grimy, bottle-thick lenses of his little grey spectacles. Then he looked away, reluctant, as always, to meet another person’s eyes for too long.

“Bring me her father,” he said.

## I

Malaf took one last sip of a coffee that had cost her the equivalent of a week’s hard translation and set the cup down on its cute little saucer. She turned it around so that it was aligned *just so*, a tiny mark of her lipstick decorating its perfect white rim.

It was early in the afternoon. Malaf had spent last night reading Lineh’s diary till tiredness made it impossible to focus, then had gone to bed only to lie there, her mind still whirring. She did sleep, but not enough, and her habit of waking up early did her no favours. She felt like death, but there was work to be done.

The coffee was *good*. Whatever illicit pipeline the restaurant had put in place to beat the sanctions, it led to somewhere in coffee-lovers’ paradise. No wonder it cost a fortune. But of course, what she had really paid for was the view.

By a stroke of luck Malaf had secured a chair by the window. The restaurant was on the top floor of one of the tallest buildings in Ramestan, and by shifting her seat around to face the glass, she could imagine she was dangling her feet over the whole world. The heaving, blocky mess of Ez Raam sprawled beneath her; even attenuated by the smog, the view was breathtaking.

All this was an extravagance, but for once Malaf felt she owed it to herself – and anyway, it was small change compared to the money she’d already spent today.

First thing in the morning, Malaf had taken a critical look at the contents of her wardrobe. If she was going to the damned party and schmooze with Ez Raam’s finest, she would need to look presentable. Her assessment had been bleak. Malaf recalled the last time her father had persuaded her to show face at one of these events. Feeling ridiculously overdressed in anything other than her usual earth tones, she had turned up dressed very much as she was now, ensuring only that her headscarf was tied a little tighter and that her coat was long enough to hide her knees. It had backfired: her plainness had made her the centre of attention.

The outfit she had assembled over the course of today might, she now suspected, be an overreaction to that experience. The dress-and-headscarf combo in a bag at her feet was a detonation of green and purple fabric, and she’d bought shoes to match with heels that could stab through body armour. She would paint her nails bright orange, and wear enough mascara to induce a heart attack from across the room. She would practically glow in the dark.

It was all part of the process of calibration. One day she’d get it right.

She looked at her phone. She had left a message on Khesri’s answering machine in the morning telling him to call her back, but so far hadn’t received a reply. That could have been for any number of reasons, the most depressing of which was that her knee-jerk attempt to phone him in the middle of the night had been enough to put her firmly back in the bad books from which she had only recently begun to emerge.

Well, never mind: she had his work number too. She dialled, for the third time today.

“Earth Sciences Department,” said a woman’s voice. “How may I help you?”

“Is Professor Khesri in?” Malaf asked.

“Who’s calling, please?”

“My name’s Sazra Imraar.” A girl she’d gone to school with. Keeping up with so many fake names was exhausting. “I’m one of his students.”

“Just one moment please...” A few moments of music, and then, once again: “I’m afraid he’s not in today.”

“Do you know when he might be coming in? It’s quite urgent.”

“I’m afraid we don’t know where he is,” the receptionist said, sounding annoyed. “He hasn’t called in to tell us he’d be away. I could pass on a message when he gets in?”

Malaf thanked her anyway and hung up. *Come on, Khesri,* she thought. *Talk to me. Tell me what Lineh called you about. Tell me why you visited RaamCo.*

She sighed, then picked up the plastic bags containing her new clothes. A view like this was one she could have spent hours watching, but she had a busy day ahead.

---

\noindent Malaf was wrong about Khesri avoiding her.

In fact, when he’d left the rambling message on her answering machine the night before, his plan had been to call her again in half an hour or so. But that hadn’t worked out, because shortly after making the call, the power had failed in his house.

Khesri groaned with frustration when his computer monitor had winked out. Night owl that he was, he had been working on a grant application, and wondered how much he had written since the last time he’d hit save.

Using his mobile phone’s screen to light the way, he went downstairs and checked the fuses. The trip switch was still in place, meaning it was an external problem. Ez Takhab’s electrical grid was an outdated patchwork mess of black-market cabling and second-hand components. It would have fallen apart years ago if not for the resourcefulness, determination and technical ingenuity of amateur electricians who needed it running well enough for them to steal from it. This was the fifth or sixth time this year that there had been a power cut; the last one had knocked the whole city out for half a day.

He lit a candle in the kitchen and put a tray under the freezer to catch meltwater. He supposed he could have called the Sagheedi woman from his mobile, but it was late anyway; that unpleasantness could wait till tomorrow.

He was just about to head up to bed when he heard someone knocking on the door.

Khesri frowned. It was far too late for visitors, but the outage had likely hit his neighbours too. He wasn’t on the best of terms with the occupants of the houses on either side: one family had a teenage son who played the drums all weekend long, and the other had an annoying habit of parking their car part-way across Khesri’s driveway. Perhaps this power outage had caused one of these families some secondary emergency. This was their hour of need. Khesri toyed with the idea of telling them to go to hell, but relented.

He went to his front door and looked through the peephole. A man was standing on his doorstep holding a torch.

The man had obviously heard Khesri’s approach, because he promptly stopped knocking and stepped back. He lowered the torch and held it so its beam illuminated his face and body. Khesri saw he was wearing a hi-vis jacket and hard hat. The badge clipped to his breast pocket showed him to be from the electricity company.

“Sir?” the man said. “I’m so sorry if I’ve woken you, sir. May I have a word?”

Khesri opened the door on a chain and peered through the crack. The stranger smiled at him, but if he was trying to appear friendly and non-threatening, being lit ghoulishly from below did him no favours.

“Good evening sir,” the man said. He looked pained. “I take it you’ve been affected too? I’m really sorry, sir – we’ve been doing some work on the distribution box at the corner of the road, and it looks like there’s been a short circuit somewhere underground. We’re just checking a few of the houses to see if we can locate the problem. Could I just ask you sir, when did you lose power?”

Khesri shrugged. “Maybe a few minutes ago.”

“That’s what we were expecting. Don’t worry, sir, we’ll likely have it fixed very soon. Could I ask you one more thing, sir? I just need to know the model number of your fuse box.”

“I don’t know what that—”

“Fear not, sir, fear not. There’s a number written along its side. If you could please just tell me that, sir, then that’ll make my job of finding the dodgy wiring about a hundred times easier.”

“All right,” Khesri said, turning away.

“It’s just a six digit number, sir,” the man said, helpfully. “Usually along the right hand side.”

“I’ll look now.”

“You star. Thank you so much sir,” the man said. “Oh, and Professor Khesri?”

Khesri replied over one shoulder: “Yes?”

“Ha!” the man from the electricity company exclaimed happily. “See? I *told* you it was him.”

At which point Khesri became more or less simultaneously aware of a number of other things. The first was that there was another man standing to one side of the entrance, hidden in the darkness. The second was that the thin chain holding the door in place presented only a moment’s difficulty to a set of heavy duty bolt cutters. The third was that there was a gun pointed at his face.

The door exploded inwards, sending him staggering backwards into the hallway. The barrel of the gun advanced as he retreated, pushing him back as if by an invisible force field. After a few paces he tripped over and pitched backwards, landing in an awkward sitting position on the floor. Without lowering his aim, the man with the gun moved aside to let his partner – the one in the hi-vis jacket, the one who’d done all the talking – step past.

A bullet through the head would have been convenient, but also noisy, and traceable, potentially, if anyone decided to look. Fortunately, Ressi was not what one would call squeamish.

He used a claw hammer.

When they were done, Ressi locked Khesri’s front door with a spare key he’d found hanging on the wall. He wiped the key with his shirt to get rid of any fingerprints, then dropped it down a drain while Payim’s shaking fingers restored the house’s electricity. Their clothes and tools went into heavy-duty refuse bags, ready to be dumped among the thousands of other such bags pitched carelessly over the barriers anywhere along the road from Ez Takhab to Ez Raam.

“It speaks volumes,” Ressi opined as they got into the van, “that our employers would rather send us all this way than try to find someone local. *Quality,* brother, that’s what we provide.”

Finding nothing to say in reply, Payim started the engine. They had a long way to go, and were scheduled to tile a bathroom the morning after. He didn’t suppose he’d get much sleep that night.

---

\noindent Stripped to her underwear, Malaf sat cross-legged in front of the full-length mirror in her bedroom. On the bed beside her she had laid out some more of the day’s purchases: a pair of sharp scissors, some bandages, and several rolls of electrical tape.

She pulled herself another long strip of tape, and held it between her teeth as she fumbled for the scissors. When she’d cut it to the right length, she got to her feet, and pasted it diagonally across her bare midriff.

Over the next few minutes she added several more strips, overlapping and at various angles. She wasn’t sure how many would be enough, or too many. The whole assemblage would have to deal with torsionally flexing abdominal muscles, plus fat, and these were not the kind of mechanical stresses the tape’s adhesive was designed for. She had various different brands of tape to try out. Research and development. If she was going to be a spy, she thought, she might as well do the job properly.

Eventually she pulled her new dress on, taking care not to snag its fabric on the tape. The dress billowed loosely around her; anything too figure-hugging was a definite no for the occasion. She assessed her reflection carefully as she twisted around at the waist, bent over, leaned back, sat down. The dress looked good. And, she had to concede, so did she.

Her phone pinged at her.

> **QASEH J:** All set?
>
> **MALAF S:** Getting there. What about you? Ready for your little camping trip?
>
> **QASEH J:** Pretty much. Just out shopping for food now. You got any dietary requirements?
>
> **MALAF S:** I’ve already told you I’m not coming with you.
>
> **QASEH J:** Did you? I must not have heard. Anyway, I’ll get you something nice.

Malaf tossed her phone onto the bed. *Idiot,* she thought.

It was still too early to call a taxi. She felt suddenly nervous, full of an energy she didn’t know how to burn off. She wanted to go for a run. To punch a wall.

As she turned, her eyes lingered on the bedroom walls’ only decoration: the map of Ramestan.

Malaf had never felt much need to fill her home with personal flourishes. As long as she had a desk to work at, she was content to make Ez Raam itself her home, with all its colours and shades; her flat was simply where she stored her body while she slept, or at most was a place where she could pace around unobserved while trying to fit a difficult French idiom into Rami. Bare white walls would have been enough for her, but her few visitors had always commented on how unlived-in the place looked. It was for their sake, rather than hers, that she’d decided to hang anything at all.

There was nothing special about it, as maps went. She’d bought it from a store that sold school supplies, choosing it for its size and level of detail. Malaf liked maps: they were *real*. As a small child she’d spent many hours browsing her father’s atlas, her favourite pages being the appendices that just showed data: cross-sections of the Earth, the layers of the atmosphere. The distances between cities. The different kinds of clouds. But even she could see that these wouldn’t have had much decorative value, and she’d settled on the map of Ramestan as a workable compromise.

Standing there looking at it now, she realised that she hated it.

It made her think of Lineh.

---

\noindent Lineh waited until the door was firmly shut before allowing Malaf to kiss her.

“Hey darling,” Malaf said, experimentally. Out loud it sounded strange, and Lineh gave her the quick, sharp look she often did whenever Malaf made any attempt to escalate their level of intimacy. She looked puzzled, and slightly irritated, as if hearing something that made no sense. *Okay,* Malaf thought. *We won’t try that again.*

“I brought you these,” Lineh said, handing Malaf a bag of pastries.

“They look delicious,” Malaf said automatically, although she noticed that they were the cheapest kind in the nearby supermarket, and appeared to have been squashed in transit. “We can have them for dessert.”

Lineh smiled politely, and stepped around her to enter the flat.

This was towards the end of their brief romance. Even at the time, Malaf was aware of it. She had watched, helplessly, as the colour leached out of their days together. Part of her still believed the relationship could be salvaged; that by spending more time together, or by showing more affection in public, risks be damned, they might be able to keep the thing alive.

But it was a losing battle, and deep down Malaf knew it. She could call it a matter of incompatible personalities, but that was too charitable. It implied an equivalence that did not exist. The truth, stated brutally, was that however much Malaf adored Lineh, Lineh was losing interest. Malaf, with her home office, her drab clothes, her few friends, was a little too boring, a little too serious, a little too clingy. Perhaps even, for Lineh, a little too old.

Lineh went into the living room and sat on the sofa, playing with her phone while Malaf finished cooking.

“This translation is killing me,” Malaf told her as they ate. “Another scientific journal article. I’ve had to learn the English words for *headspace gas chromatography* and *flame ionisation detector.* I don’t even know what those are in Rami. I wish they’d picked someone else for it.”

“You didn’t have to say yes,” Lineh pointed out.

“The things we do for money, eh?”

Lineh shrugged. She had put her phone to one side, deliberately face down so she wouldn’t see any flashing notifications; but her eyes kept straying to it anyway.

“Stressed at work?” Malaf asked.

Lineh shrugged again, and the conversation lay where they left it.

Later Malaf cleared their plates away and went to the kitchen to wash them. When she returned, with Lineh’s pastries arrayed as prettily as she could manage on a dish, she was astonished to see that Lineh had lit a cigarette.

“I should have asked,” Lineh apologised. “Do you mind?”

“No, not at all,” Malaf replied quickly. “I just didn’t know you...”

She was being ridiculous: she’d *seen* Lineh smoke, and Malaf had smoked with her. But doing shisha in Café Kesh over board games and bad French fitted into a different conceptual category for Malaf. Shisha was something everybody did, because what else was there to do in Ez Raam? But the sight of Lineh smoking something as vulgar as a cigarette was strangely upsetting for Malaf.

They talked, but not much. When she had finished the cigarette Lineh scooted up to let Malaf sit beside her on the sofa. Malaf leaned back against her, and Lineh put her arm around her, long fingers idly stroking the hair around Malaf’s ear in a way she knew Malaf liked.

“Tell me the worst thing you ever did,” Lineh said, softly.

From the angle Malaf was lying at, it was impossible to turn her head and see the expression on Lineh’s face. “I do so many terrible things,” she replied, guardedly. “How far in my catalogue of sins do you want me to go back?”

“Ever. The worst thing you ever did.”

Malaf shrugged.

“Want to know mine?” Lineh asked.

Malaf was silent for a while. “I’m not sure,” she answered. “Are you sure you want to tell me?”

“You know I used to live in Copenhagen, didn’t you?”

“Yes, you told me. With your sister.”

“Her name’s Malaf too, you know.”

“You told me,” Malaf said again.

“Well. I don’t know if I mentioned it before... actually, I do know I never mentioned it before, because I don’t talk about it. But I used to work for the Purity Board.”

A pause here, Lineh gauging Malaf’s reaction. Was this the bad thing she’d done? It didn’t sound like much. Not exactly knowing what was expected of her, Malaf said, “Oh.”

“This was right out of school,” Lineh went on. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do, didn’t have the grades for uni. My uncle knew someone, he got me the job. I was based in the big building on Preeha Istar (Martyr) Street, you know it? It was just admin work: photocopying, sending emails. Scheduling meeting rooms. I hated it. The pay was crap and nobody knew my name or cared about it, but you know what it’s like. A job’s a job.”

“You have to take what you’re given,” Malaf agreed.

“Mostly I was just filing applications for performance licenses. Musicians would send in CDs of their music, some higher-up would give it a listen and decide whether it was something that should be allowed to be played in public. Most of the time it would be a yes: if you’ve decided to go through proper legal channels, chances are you already know your stuff won’t have us calling the Guards on you.”

“Did you ever listen to any of the music?”

“No. There were specialists for that. They listened with headphones so no sinfulness could leak out.”

“Brave of them, to take the risk of hearing it themselves.”

“Right,” Lineh said. “Heroes, the lot of them. Anyway. There was this woman there called Shiryi, who outranked me by some tiny amount and thought that gave her the right to treat me like dirt all the time. Criticising me for every little thing, always threatening to report me for something or other. For my work, if I made a mistake at work. If I didn’t, it would be for my clothes, or my ‘improper conduct’ at work.”

Malaf traced a finger up Lineh’s bare arm. “If only she knew about your conduct *outside* work,” she said slyly.

Lineh shrugged off the attempt to lighten the mood. “Anyway, one day, I did something of... questionable wisdom. I’d been invited to a party that evening. I’d managed to score a bottle of wine. But there were logistical issues. They were going to start early, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to go home. So...”

“Wow.” Malaf raised her eyebrows. “You brought a bottle of wine into the headquarters of the Purity Board?”

“Yeah. I left it in the cloakroom with everyone else’s bags the whole day.”

“That was... ballsy.”

“I look back on it now and I can’t believe it,” Lineh said. “So stupid.”

“Well... if that’s the dumbest thing you ever did when you were young,” Malaf assured her, “you’ve got off light.”

“Yeah, well. It didn’t seem that way when we got raided by the Guards.”

Malaf shifted her position so she could see Lineh’s face. “Really?”

“Yeah. Just my luck, eh? Surprise inspection. Nobody allowed to leave.”

“I didn’t realise those happened to government offices.”

“The Guards raid *especially* government offices,” Lineh said, sounding surprised that Malaf would not know this. “It happened twice while I was there. It was all political, of course. Some Board member in the pocket of a mullah who’d had a falling-out with another mullah, or driven over his cat or something. Factions trying to ruin one another’s day. Even the Guards knew it was only theatre. They were just going through the motions: turn up, ask to be shown around, ask some questions, sound tough. Then they’d go back to their bosses, say we’d all been sufficiently intimidated, but that they’d found nothing.”

“*Did* they find nothing?”

“They found the wine.”

“Shit. Did they... did they tie it to you?”

“No.”

“Lucky.”

“No,” Lineh sighed. “Not lucky. They found it in Shiryi’s bag.”

Malaf said nothing.

“That’s right,” Lineh went on, quietly. “They announced over the speakers that the Guards were coming to inspect us. We were all nervous, but everyone made a joke of it. When I told them I wanted to go to the bathroom, everyone laughed and said I was going to hide some evidence. And you know what? I could have done. I could have taken the bottle out of my bag and hidden it anywhere. But I didn’t. I put it in her bag instead, and I left it unzipped so you’d have to have been blind to miss it.”

“You wanted the Guards to find it?”

“Of course. I remember thinking, what if they *don’t?* Then I’d have had a real problem. I’d have had to go back out again to put it back into my bag before Shiryi or anyone else got to it. But no: they saved me the trouble.”

“What happened?”

“We knew straight away that they’d found something. The mood changed completely when they realised they would actually have to *do* something that day. Suddenly everything became very official. Guns held properly, orders being given. Their captain went into the manager’s office. A minute later the manager asked Shiryi to come in. I didn’t actually see what happened next. When the Guards left they went by my desk, and I could see Shiryi wasn’t with them.”

“They didn’t arrest her?”

Lineh shook her head. “I don’t know if the manager paid them off, or if they just didn’t want the hassle, or both. We could all hear her crying coming in the office, for a while, then nothing. She left straight away. Later someone we didn’t know came to her desk with a cardboard box to clear up.”

“What happened to her after that?”

“I don’t know. You could say she got lucky with the punishment. It could have meant jail time. Lashes. Obviously she never worked for the government again.” Lineh shrugged. “I don’t even know if I’d have felt all that bad about it if she had gone to jail. Probably, eventually, I’d have been sad about it. I’m sad now. The funny thing is, I don’t really know why I did it to her. I can’t even say it was to save myself. It was pure, pointless malice on my part. She was a total bitch, but nobody deserved what I did to her.” She looked down at Malaf. Her eyes were dry, her voice as flat as a speaking clock. “And everyone keeps telling me how nice I am,” she went on, with a small smile. “How valuable a co-worker, always friendly and ready to help. They don’t know who I am.”

“Well,” Malaf told her, softly. “It was a long time ago. You’re another person now, aren’t you?”

Lineh tipped her head on one side, an acknowledgement just short of a nod.

“People do change, you know,” Malaf said. “They grow up. We all do awful things sometimes. It doesn’t have to define us for our whole lives.” She held her hands out uselessly, hating herself for talking in clichés but unable to find anything better to say. “It’s not who you are any more,” she finished, lamely.

Lineh just shrugged, as if dismissing a point not worth arguing about.

“You’re a good person,” Malaf whispered. “I know that.”

They sat in silence for a long time, Lineh’s fingers continuing to stroke Malaf’s hair soothingly, as if Malaf were the one needing to be comforted. After a while the caress moved lower, Lineh tracing her fingers along the bare skin of Malaf’s neck, her shoulders and chest. Carefully Malaf turned over, pulled herself upright. She kissed Lineh, and Lineh kissed back, and began to unbutton her dress.

Later, as they lay in each other’s arms under the bedsheets, Malaf wondered what had prompted her friend’s confession. Had it been meant to bring them closer together? Or had her intention been to sully the idealised image in Malaf’s mind of a Lineh without any flaws? Perhaps Malaf was now supposed to hate her, or at least love her less. Maybe Lineh, bracing herself for their inevitable separation, wanted to make the breakup as much Malaf’s idea as her own.

This interpretation, whether accurate or not, filled Malaf with sudden outrage. I mean *really?* Did Lineh *actually believe* that Malaf needed to be protected in this way? That Malaf’s infatuation with her had made her so fragile, so emotional, so incapable of honest reflection, that Lineh had to act this way to soften the blow? How *dare* she? Who did she think she was?

And the worst part of it: if that was Lineh’s plan, was this lame story of betrayal the best she could do? Did she really think Malaf’s life had been so boring that she would be impressed by *that?* Did Lineh really think so little of her?

In spite of everything, she found herself grinning. Oh, my dear darling Lineh. You think *you* did something dumb once? Well fuck you, girlfriend, because you’re about to go down in flames.

“Hey,” Malaf said, as if out of nowhere. “Did I ever tell you I once made a lot of money smuggling drugs?”

Lineh opened an eye. “Mm?”

“That’s right,” Malaf said. “When we were students, we drove out to an abandoned town on the border. Miles from anywhere. We met up with a gang of drug runners we’d met online, bought their gear, and fenced it to dealers in Ez Raam.”

Lineh had propped herself up on one elbow and was staring at her. “*You?*” she eventually asked.

“Me. In my lawless youth. My friend made the contacts, I planned the exchange. We drove there in our friend’s bandmate’s van.” Malaf chuckled. “That van was such a piece of crap, every time we went we wondered if we’d even make it home.”

“You did this a lot?”

“Oh, quite a few times,” Malaf said airily. She watched Lineh’s expression of slowly dawning surprise; basked in it. “It was scary, I suppose, but a lot of fun, too. We didn’t even make much money from it, not after splitting it with the rest of the crew.”

“The crew?”

“Six of us. We called ourselves... well, one of us called us the Big Q gang. I haven’t seen them in years. Last I heard of them, they were doing online activism, stealing government documents and publishing them online. Remember the Justice Olaar Koobi leak?”

“No.”

“Oh. Well. That was them. Nothing to do with me by that point.”

Lineh regarded Malaf with amazement. “And you did this where?”

“You won’t have heard of it. A town on the border that had the crap bombed out of it during the war. It’s just ruins now. Nobody lives there any more. They don’t even put it on maps.”

Automatically, both pairs of eyes went to the map hanging on the wall beside the bed.

Lineh sat up, pulling the bedsheet around her shoulders like a cape. “Where?” she asked.

“Here,” Malaf said, pointing to the spot.

Malaf the translator always kept pens in reach of the bed, ready to use in those late-night moments of linguistic inspiration. She picked up a black marker. Light-headed with the relief of sharing this secret at last, she drew a fat black arrow on the map, restoring the town to its rightful place.

She wrote its name, sounding out the letters of its name one by one as she wrote.

“It was called Ez Nezeshti.”

## II

In the last few minutes there hadn’t been any additional gunshots.

Malaf was crouching in the darkest corner of what had once been an open-plan office, in a small building chosen at random from the row of ruined structures on this side of the street. Though its outer walls were badly bullet-scarred, the office’s insides were eerily well-preserved. Looters had helped themselves to most of the office equipment, but a few museum-piece computers had been piled up carelessly in one corner. A poster on the wall, ripped in two but with both sides still attached and drooping, showed sales targets for the fiscal quarter of the year the war began.

She considered her options.

The men searching for her were heavily armed and happy to kill, but as far as she could tell, there were only two of them, and they had a lot of territory to cover. Apart from thirst and hunger, there was no reason why the ruins of Ez Nezeshti couldn’t keep her hidden from them more or less indefinitely. But they had travelled a huge distance to come here. They knew her name, and they hadn’t been shy about showing their faces. The implication was clear: they wouldn’t give up and go home after a few hours. They wouldn’t leave until their job was done.

Sooner or later, unless she found a way out, they would find her, and they would kill her.

She needed to get to higher ground.

Carefully, Malaf unfolded herself out of her corner and headed for the exit. Leaving the office, she found the building’s main stairwell and climbed three storeys. A second, smaller staircase led further upwards, ending in a trapdoor that had been left open.

Crouching down low, Malaf climbed the first few steps and poked her head into the sunlight. The roof was flat and long, surrounded by a low wall of grey brick.

Malaf emerged from the stairwell on hands and knees, then crawled out onto the sticky, hot roof, testing its strength. When she was convinced it could stand her weight she got to her feet and, still crouching down with her head below the level of the wall, made her way to one of its corners.

She poked her head over the wall and looked down. She had good visibility along the length of the street in both directions. She could imagine this spot having made a good sniper nest during the battle.

As she peered around she saw movement: figures, two of them, emerging from a side road and onto the street.

Quickly she jerked her head back. She’d caught only the briefest glimpse. Had they seen her? She forced herself to count to ten, slow her breathing. Maybe their eyes had been scanning the rooftops as well as the street. Maybe they’d spotted her. But there had been no sudden commotion, no shout, no running footsteps. Did that mean they hadn’t seen her? Or that they had, and were sneaking up on her, getting into a better shooting position? Or were the two figures Irooj and Tusham?

On her hands and knees, Malaf shuffled to another section of the wall, closer to where the two figures had been walking. She took a deep breath, and another, then risked a second look.

This time she could see more clearly. There was no doubt about it now: two men, holding guns, looking around for someone to kill.

---

\noindent Sometimes, privately, in reflective moments, Ressi felt concern that his brother might be somewhat oversensitive. Shooting that man just now, and having come so close to getting shot himself, seemed to have been a real downer for Payim, and so far he’d resisted all Ressi’s attempts to cheer him up.

Still: it did no harm to keep on trying.

“I was thinking,” Ressi said a bright, conversational tone, “we’ll have earned ourselves a nice little break after all this. Remember that time we took that boat tour in Ez Nasha?”

Payim shrugged glumly.

Ressi peered through the window of an office building, shielding his eyes with the hand not holding the gun.

“We should do that again,” he went on. “Do you remember those little *foie gras* things they gave us? Those cute little parcels? I can’t get over how they folded them so sma—”

Ressi’s words ended in a scream and he dropped to the ground as though flattened by an invisible sledgehammer. Simultaneously, something grey streaked downwards past Payim’s eyes and smacked into the pavement a metre or so from where he was standing. It took an instant for him to identify it: a brick, one of two that had fallen with a murderous velocity, the other of which had caught Ressi on the shoulder.

Payim looked up at the roof of the building beside him and caught the last few milliseconds of the Sagheedi woman’s head pulling back out of sight.

“Motherfucker!” Ressi yelled, clutching his shoulder and rolling on the ground in agony.

Payim knelt down and tried to pull his brother to his feet, but Ressi’s fist swung out at him, chasing him away. “Get your hands off me!” he shrieked.

“I’m trying to help—”

“Stop helping and kill that fucking bitch!” Ressi said. “Get in there!”

---

\noindent Malaf bolted across the rooftop. Stupid, stupid, *stupid!*

It had been a split-second decision. They were there, the bricks were there – would there ever have been a better opportunity? It was too tempting to pass up, and her aim hadn’t been bad, even with the one in her left hand. It might have been a good plan, except for the awkward detail that anything other than a one hundred percent successful direct hit on both targets at once would have the effect of revealing her position, which happened to be an easily accessible rooftop from which she had no means of escaping.

Malaf heard footsteps and knew one of them had entered the building. She took one more look over the wall and saw the other one – the one she’d hit, painfully but not fatally. In the brief glimpse she saw him lurching to his feet, heading away from the building. All the better, she realised, to cover its entrance and make sure she didn’t sneak out.

She looked at the trapdoor. Any moment now Payim would come out of it and start shooting. No way of locking it or jamming it shut. There were other loose brick fragments scattered across the rooftop, but how many seconds would throwing those buy her?

She ran to the other side of the building. Was there anything there? Any way off this damned roof?

She saw, to her amazement, that there was.

She peered over the perimeter wall saw that another building adjoined this one. She looked down onto its black roof.

The drop from this roof to that one was higher than she would have liked.

Nevertheless, she pushed off the floor and pulled herself up, feet scrabbling at the brickwork as she clambered awkwardly up on top. She turned, straddling the wall, then lifted her other leg over the side. The manoeuvre nearly made her lose her balance. The height made her feel sick. She lost a precious few seconds sitting there, fighting back the fear, not looking down. Then, as quickly as she dared, she began to lower herself over the edge.

She hung there, arms stretching, feet dangling, bracing herself for the drop. She would let go, and hope she landed well and didn’t break both her legs. That was when she looked down, and realised she’d made a terrible mistake.

Her building and the lower one *weren’t actually connected*.

She hadn’t been able to see it from her original position, but now it was horribly apparent that there was a space that separated the two buildings. It was so narrow it boggled the mind that the builders had put it there at all: it seemed almost spiteful. Whatever its original purpose, it was just wide enough that, if she let go now, she would drop neatly into it like a coin into a piggy bank, and fall to her death.

She didn’t have the strength in her arms to pull herself back up.

Sweating, swearing, she pulled hard anyway, and managed to get a toe grip on the wall. That let her get another foot up. She reckoned she had enough of a hold on the ledge to last her another few seconds. Perhaps that would be enough time for the assassin to find his way to the rooftop, catch sight of her fingertips poking over the brickwork, saunter over, look down at her, then either shoot her in the head at close range or else stand there and wait for her to fall.

Meanwhile, her muscles were beginning to burn, and the longer she waited in this position, the less strength she’d have in her legs when she finally worked up the courage to do what she had to do, which was to push herself off the wall and launch herself into space.

Oh well, she thought. I’ll either die or I won’t. Let’s get it over with. No sense hanging around.

She thought: *hanging around!* She was hilarious sometimes. Then she thought: *oh well...*

And jumped.

Her back hitting the roof an instant later felt like a hammer blow to every part of her body at once. It flattened the air out of her lungs like a hand slamming down on a paper bag. *Breathe in,* she told herself, and couldn’t.

That was it, she thought. She’d broken her spine. Paralysed from the neck down. She would die on this roof and the carrion birds would peck at her carcass until there was nothing left but a skeleton.

Then, after the longest few seconds of her life had passed, she gasped a long, slow inhalation, coughed it back out again, and found, almost to her annoyance, that she was still alive, and would have to start running again.

She rolled over onto her side and pulled herself up. She was unsteady on her feet for a few seconds. The roofing material didn’t feel entirely stable underfoot; it had a slight give that partially explained how she’d landed without breaking a bone. She’d done something to her leg though, which was strangely numb in a way that hinted that when feeling returned, what would be felt would, primarily, be pain.

She immediately saw why the roof had felt unstable. This building had not fared as well in the bombing as its neighbour. It had obviously taken a few direct artillery hits and the roofing material had rucked up and deformed like a kicked carpet. A mortar blast had torn off an entire top corner of the building, and the bitumen roofing she was standing on drooped down like a sticky black tongue into the exposed office below.

She heard a noise behind her and above. A loud throat-clearing, which quickly became the prolonged coughing fit of a man with bad allergies who’d spent too much time running around in derelict buildings.

She looked around and saw the silhouette of a man’s head. He was on the roof above her.

Malaf raced to the point where the bitumen beneath her feet began to slope downwards. Half sliding and half crab-walking on palms and feet, she launched herself into a barely-controlled skitter downhill.

“Hey!”

She heard the yell from the rooftop behind her. It wasn’t clear to Malaf what this attempt at communication was meant to achieve, followed as it was by a pair of gunshots. Maybe a try to get her to hesitate and make herself an easier target, or else a cry of frustration that she was getting away.

A second later Malaf had slid out of sight of the shooter.

The slope of the damaged roof didn’t reach all the way into the floor of the exposed room below. There was a drop of a few feet, which Malaf made with a painful, ankle-twisting lack of elegance. She landed in what had once been another office, but was now little more than a skeleton of broken beams and scattered masonry, exposed on two sides by walls that had been blasted open. Malaf found a door and ran deeper into the building. A moment later she heard a thud from above: Payim landing heavily on the roof over her head.

---

\noindent Irooj and Tusham both ducked reflexively when they heard the gunshots. Irooj looked around, trying to gauge the distance; Tusham grunted indifferently and went back to work trying to shift the car.

The Pasham Sixty had this to be said for it: for a car of its size, it was heavy. It was the kind of car you could drive into a wall in the confidence that it would be the wall, and not the car, that would suffer the most damage (although the damage such a collision would inflict on anybody travelling *in* the car was another matter entirely). Though its chassis was dented and shiny from fresh gouges, it was still eminently drivable. Apart from the shattered windows, Irooj had seen worse in normal use on the highways of Ez Raam. But the crash had beached it on rubble: the car’s front wheels weren’t in contact with the ground. If they were going to drive it out of here, Tusham would have to move it.

He tried again, inserting his huge body in the gap between the front of the car and what was left of the wall. He’d tried shoving with his arms and got nowhere. Now he tried the reverse, his back to the wall, trying to push two-legged against the car’s front corner.

Irooj tried helping too but didn’t have the strength or weight for it. So she watched her husband, and watched the road ahead, ready to raise the alarm if she saw movement.

Two shots she’d heard, then nothing. She listened, tense, waiting for any other sound over Tusham’s strained grunting.

“Come on,” she hissed through her teeth. “Come on!”

---

\noindent Malaf was in a long and empty hallway, running for her life.

Open doors on either side of her let in barely enough daylight to see by. She shot a glance into each one, ready to double back in case one of them led to a staircase, but saw only offices, empty meeting rooms. No, the stairs were right in front of her, at the end of the long corridor.

She had almost made it when she heard Payim’s footsteps behind her.

She looked over a shoulder and saw him raise the gun, taking aim two-handed. Malaf skidded to a halt and hurled herself through the nearest side door. Payim fired once, missed.

She found herself in a large conference room, brightly lit: its floor was still carpeted with shards of glass from its long-gone windows. An elliptical O-shaped table ran along its length, a sad-looking slide projector sitting lonely at one end. For a moment Malaf thought she was trapped, but then she saw a second door at the far end of the room. She ran for it.

---

\noindent Ressi stood gritting his teeth through the pain in his injured shoulder. He wondered if the falling brick had fractured a bone up there. He pressed it gingerly with his left hand, trying to control the agony. When he took his hand away his palm had blood on it.

He was thinking about peeling off his shirt and assessing the damage when he heard the gunshot. His head snapped around in surprise: how had they got over *there?* Realising he’d been watching the wrong building, he turned his attention to its neighbour. This new building had a bigger, L-shaped footprint and, as Ressi quickly realised, had more ways in and out than he could cover from out here on the street.

Cursing Payim for not being able to get a single thing right today, he headed for the building’s main entrance.

---

\noindent Payim burst into the conference room, gun arm extended. He swept the room from left to right, ready to fire, but saw no sign of her.

Under the table? He crouched down to check. Nothing.

So either she’d leapt out of the window – unlikely, but by now Payim wouldn’t have put anything past the woman – or through the door at the far end.

He realised his hands were shaking. He swallowed drily, took a deep breath.

Then he broke into a run. He sprinted through the conference room and through the doorway into the next room: a staff kitchen, dark and windowless. A table where office workers had eaten lunch. A sink, a coffee machine, a space where a microwave oven might have sat. A tall refrigerator covered in magnets, a dishwasher.

Another door led out into the corridor. He took a step towards it – and realised too late he’d turned his back on a blind spot.

And as he began to turn, Malaf, who had been standing behind the door holding a microwave in two hands high above her head, leapt forward, and swung the thing down as hard as she could into Payim’s back.

This did not have the devastating impact she had hoped for. A microwave oven is mostly empty space, and the one she had grabbed off the counter had weighed only around eleven kilos. Malaf was not a particularly strong woman, and neither was she tall enough to get much of a drop on him. Nevertheless, the surprise of the blow was enough to knock Payim off his feet and send him crashing down face-first to the floor. Malaf might have used this moment to her advantage, but she’d thrown the whole of her bodyweight into the manoeuvre, and so she lost her balance too. The microwave flew out of her hands, and she tipped forward, landing on top of Payim’s legs.

Payim lost his grip on the gun. It spun from his hand across the kitchen floor and through the open door into the corridor outside. He stretched out an arm to try to snatch it back, but it was far out of his reach and Malaf was pinning his legs down. So, still lying on his belly, he crooked an arm out behind himself and began pawing at his lower back.

Malaf understood instantly: *Payim had another gun*. The weapon he’d taken from Abeej was sticking out of the back pocket of his trousers.

Malaf couldn’t make it to the gun in time, so she grabbed Payim’s arm instead and forced it away. Payim, who couldn’t see what was happening, only felt a wrench of pain as Malaf dug her fingers into the flesh of his wrist. He kicked with both legs, bucking and twisting. Malaf was rolled off Payim and onto the floor. She made another grab for the gun but received a kick in the jaw that made her ears ring and set fireworks off behind her eyes.

Payim managed to get onto all fours and started crawling. Forgetting the gun in his pocket, he lurched forwards, through the kitchen door, heading for the one he’d dropped. Malaf was still struggling to get her knees when he reached it. In one fluid movement Payim snatched up the gun, stood up and spun around, bringing it around to point at her.

He squeezed the trigger and fired at the exact instant a body slammed into him from the side.

The crash-tackle knocked Payim off his feet and threw his aim enough for the bullet to pass over Malaf’s head. Malaf, still reeling from the kick, was barely aware of how close a call she had just had. It took her a moment to refocus on what was happening.

What was happening was this: Payim was rolling around on the floor, locked in a wrestling match with Qaseh. Payim was trying to bring his gun to bear on Qaseh’s head; Qaseh had one hand around Payim’s wrist, and another in his face, clawing at Payim’s mouth, his eyes.

Malaf got up and ran over. She aimed a kick at Payim’s head. She missed, getting his shoulder instead, but it was enough to make him drop the gun. Qaseh saw that the gun was in reach and tried to grab it, but Payim rolled over so he was lying on top of it.

Malaf pointed. “He’s got—”

But Qaseh had already seen it: the second gun in Payim’s back pocket. He had to get part-way off Payim to get to it, which gave Payim enough freedom to grab the weapon he’d dropped. Both men tried to shoot at once, but only a single gun fired.

It turned out to have been Qaseh’s.

Payim’s body jerked violently. A look of astonishment crossed his face. Then, after that tiniest of hesitations, he continued to bring his gun around, taking aim at Qaseh.

Malaf was on him immediately, kicking his arm away. Payim tried again, a little less forcefully this time. Another kick from Malaf. This time he dropped the gun.

Payim looked around at her, his mouth moving soundlessly, his throat making gulping motions. He licked his lips as if about to speak. Then the last of the strength drained out of him, and he lay there, motionless, eyes blank.

Malaf stared down at Payim for what felt like a long time; then it was as if her knees had simply ceased to function. She crumpled to a sitting position beside his body. There was a growing puddle of blood on the floor, and she moved her feet out of its way.

Qaseh managed to prop himself into a seated position against the wall. Still gasping for breath, he tore his eyes from Payim’s face. He looked at Malaf, then back to Payim. Then back to Malaf again.

“You okay?” he asked.

Malaf was uncertain how a question like that could be answered.

---

\noindent Outside, one last push got the Sixty clear of the rubble. As the weight finally shifted and the car began to roll on all four wheels, Tusham let out a long exhale and slumped to the ground, exhausted. Irooj clapped with joyful relief.

She got inside and turned the ignition, and the whine of its engine was the sweetest music she’d ever heard.

---

\noindent The gun that had ended up in Qaseh’s hand was Qaseh’s own. Expertly he ejected the magazine, inspected the little windows along its length.

“Only two rounds left,” he told Malaf, holding it out to her. Grudgingly she accepted it. It felt incredibly heavy. “The safety is *on*. See the lever on the left of the slide? Up for safe, *down* to fire. Got that?”

“Yes.”

Next, Qaseh picked up Payim’s gun. This model he was less familiar with. For the tiniest instant an expression of pleasure crossed his face. It was the look of a keen hobbyist seeing one of *these* beauties for the first time. Malaf noticed it and felt sick.

“Not much better,” he said, referring to the ammo in its magazine. Then he pointed to Payim. “Where’s his friend?”

“Close,” Malaf said, getting down on her hands and knees and shuffling over to where Payim lay dead. “Last I saw, he was on the street outside.”

Fighting an urge to vomit, Malaf patted down Payim’s trouser pockets. Something jingled. She could have wept. Reaching inside with the very tips of two long fingers she carefully withdrew Qaseh’s car keys.

“Thank God,” she breathed, showing them to Qaseh.

Leaving Payim’s body, they walked down the corridor. Malaf watched Qaseh move: gun in both hands, half-crouching, pivoting his body around to check each doorway for a potential ambush. To Malaf it looked polished, professional. But she was hardly an expert: to anyone else it might just have looked like he’d spent too long online gaming.

“Who are they, Malaf?” Qaseh asked in a terse whisper.

“Nobody I know.”

“Well, they sure know who *you* are. When the shooting started I assumed it was the Big Q gang they were after. Egomaniac that I am.” Qaseh almost smiled. “Made any enemies in Ez Raam lately?”

Malaf thought back to the events at her father’s party, and said, quietly, “At least one.”

They froze mid-stride when they heard a noise: the beeping, distant, but approaching rapidly, of a car’s horn.

---

“What are you doing?” Tusham hissed. “Stop it!”

Irooj, driving the Sixty as fast as it could go over the broken roads, ignored him and pounded the car’s horn some more.

“What are you *doing?*” Tusham asked again. “They’ll know we’re coming.”

“That’s the idea.”

“I mean the men with guns will know.”

“Good!” Irooj screamed it through the broken windscreen. “Come on out, you bastards! You want to get in my way again? I’ll run you down and show you what your insides look like!”

---

\noindent “They’re coming,” Qaseh said. “Move!”

They had found the stairwell. It was dark and windowless. Qaseh went down first, checking around blind corners, gun at the ready. Malaf limped after him, guarding the rear.

At ground level they found themselves in another long corridor. A set of double doors at one end led to the building’s main reception. Light shone around their frames as if they were the gateway to paradise. They ran for it.

They had made it about halfway there before Malaf heard the noise. She looked over her shoulder and saw Ressi stepping into the corridor behind them, gun raised.

“Behind!” she yelled. Malaf jumped through a doorway to the left; Qaseh went right. He spun around and dropped to one knee in the doorway, firing once. Ressi shot back, his bullet tearing splinters out of the woodwork Qaseh was hiding behind. Qaseh scooted back further out of the way, but the shelter he’d found wasn’t even a room: it was just a pipe- and cable-filled utility space, barely big enough for him to hide in between its door and back wall.

“Find another way out!” Qaseh yelled. Malaf could barely hear him over the ringing in her ears. “A window, anything!”

Malaf nodded. She was in a short corridor perpendicular to the first one. It was very dark: no stray light coming from outside, no hints that there was another exit. She could just make out another staircase in the distance, heading up. That was no good. But there had to be something. She ran.

Qaseh risked another look down the length of the corridor, jerking his head back immediately when Ressi took another shot at him. This time Ressi was closer: Ressi knew he had him trapped, and was working his way from one point of cover to the next.

Qaseh swore. He was running out of time and ammo. The door to the outside was tantalisingly close.

He stood up, pressing himself against the back wall of his hiding place. He pointed his gun out into the corridor, fired once, blindly, to drive Ressi to take cover. Then he ran.

He ran sideways, barely seeing where he was going, looking backwards often for any sign of movement. He saw Ressi’s head peeping around a distant doorframe. Qaseh fired, missing widely but scaring Ressi enough to pull his head back in, and continued his dash for the exit. He hit the double doors at a full run.

And bounced off them.

He realised, too late, that they were locked.

Further down the corridor, Ressi fired again. The shot blasted apart the wood of the door beside Qaseh’s head. Qaseh ducked down, aware that Ressi was screaming something at him but unable to make out the words. From his crouched position he fired back. He hadn’t been counting, but suspected that that might have been his last round.

In that one second, he looked back at the door and saw that it was held shut by a simple metal latch at ground level. Frantically he grabbed at it and lifted the little iron bar out of its notch in the floor. The door swung open under the weight of his body and he spilled out through it and into the bright sunlight of the street.

At exactly that moment, Ressi fired again. The bullet punched a hole through the door as it swung closed.

The other thing it punched a hole through was Qaseh.

---

\noindent With the door to the outside world shut, Ressi couldn’t know for sure that he’d hit Qaseh. But knew he had him on the run. That was enough.

Roaring with animal exhilaration he ran down the corridor, slamming his body into the door. He wanted to push it open and follow his quarry out into the street, but found the door as immovable as Qaseh had done. More so, in fact: not only was it again locked, its latch having fallen back into place; it would also have had to open outwards against the weight of Qaseh, who had sunk to a sitting position with his back to the door, by now well into the process of bleeding to death.

Ressi rolled his eyes. *Unbelievable!* And with his idiot brother nowhere to be seen and the Sagheedi bitch getting further away...

He’d banged his injured shoulder trying to ram the door open. Grimacing with pain, he abandoned that exit and ran the direction Malaf had gone, deeper into the darkness.

---

\noindent “There!” Tusham pointed through the shattered windscreen.

Irooj had seen it too. “Oh God. Qaseh...”

She floored it for the short distance to Qaseh’s body and pulled up sharply, feeling her tyres spin on dust. Her friend’s shirt was dark with blood. Without checking to see if the coast was clear she jumped from the driver’s seat and ran to him.

“Careful,” Tusham hissed, eyes sweeping the surroundings.

“He’s still alive,” Irooj said. “Qaseh? *Qaseh?*”

Qaseh’s eyelids fluttered open. He looked at Irooj but his eyes struggled to focus on hers. He tried to say something but the sounds made no sense to her.

“Shit. Shit.” She thought of a first aid course she’d taken once, years ago. Bullet wounds are puncture wounds. She yanked at Qaseh’s shirt until the buttons tore free. There was a hole in his chest, below the ribcage, its edges hard to make out from all the blood. No corresponding exit hole on the other side of this body. Control the bleeding. Pressure on the wound.

Irooj folded Qaseh’s shirt into a wad of flat fabric. While she pushed it down against the wound, leaning her whole weight into it, Tusham picked up the gun that had fallen from his hand. He checked its magazine. “Empty,” he said. “Irooj, they could come back any minute.”

“I know!” she snapped at him.

Tusham was crouching beside her. “What can I do?” he asked urgently.

Irooj squeezed her eyes shut, thinking. Qaseh had already lost a lot of blood. Even if they could control the bleeding, his only chance was to get him to a hospital. The nearest one was hours away.

Except...

Except it *wasn’t*.

The nearest *Ramestani* hospital was hours away, but there were others. Ez Nezeshti was a border town. They’d chosen it in their smuggling days partly because it was easy to get to from the other side. She thought back to the maps they’d brought with them. There was a big town not too far away. Between them and that town, a national border. Illegal to cross. That meant border police. A military presence. Field medics. Helicopter airlifts.

They were here right now, together: Irooj, Tusham and Qaseh. They had a car. They could leave Ez Nezeshti this instant. With Qaseh bleeding out, every second counted.

But what about Malaf?

“Tusham,” she snapped hoarsely. “The radio. Malaf had the radio. Check the car.”

He went to the Sixty, checked the front and back seats and footwells. “I don’t see it.” He opened the glovebox. “It’s not here.”

“We had it when we crashed. Look harder!”

“Irooj—”

“Damn it, I had it *in my hand.”*

“Irooj, it’s *gone.*”

“Shit. Shit!” Irooj hissed. Then, speaking quickly and evenly: “Qaseh. Qaseh, listen to me: where is Malaf?”

Qaseh tried to say something but couldn’t find the breath in his lungs for it.

“Have they killed her? Qaseh? I need you to tell me: *is Malaf still alive?*”

Qaseh, barely conscious, said nothing.

Irooj swore under her breath. There were tears in her eyes, because as much as she would have liked to deny it, some coldly detached part of her brain had already done the calculation. They were unarmed against men with guns who wanted them dead, and every second they waited put all of them in danger. They had the means of escaping now and may not have it a minute later. There had been gunshots, and they had no way of knowing if Malaf was still alive. Meanwhile front of her, torquing and flexing against her hands as she pressed down on him, was a man who would surely die if they didn’t move.

She asked herself what Malaf would do.

“Get him into the car,” she told Tusham. Irooj was crying but her voice was firm. “Back seat. Sit with him. Keep your hands on him *like this,* see?”

Tusham nodded, and went to work.

Irooj helped him lift, then got into the driver’s seat. *Last few seconds, Malaf. Please...*

When she felt she couldn’t wait any longer: “Are you ready?”

“Yes.”

Irooj took one look at over her shoulder at the dying man stretched out over the seats, then closed her eyes and offered a single, silent prayer. *Malaf,* she thought, her heart aching. *Malaf, my old friend: please be dead. Please let this have been the right thing to have done.*

Then she put the car in gear and drove as if the Devil himself was right behind them.

And Malaf, still looking for a way out, heard the sounds of the car’s engine fade into the distance.

## III

Blessed Martyrs Hospital had become a guarded fortress.

The Supreme Leader’s official residence was one of the largest palaces in Ez Raam, dwarfing even the one owned by the President. The details of its interior were kept hidden from the public, but it was known to be well-equipped with medical hardware and drugs, with everything from dialysis machines to dentist’s drills on standby. The fact that the Supreme Leader’s crack team of personal live-in physicians had chosen not to treat him in-house, and to have him moved to Blessed Martyrs instead, was a bigger clue to the seriousness of his condition than anything else the government had released.

Even before his helicopter had touched down, soldiers had surrounded the hospital. These were drawn from those units known to be most loyal to the Supreme Leader. Officially, their job was crowd control, and this indeed was what they had spent most of their time doing, pushing back against distraught pilgrims trying to force their small offerings through the railings. Unspoken, though, was the fact that the main threat could well be *other* army units, commanded by opportunistic members of some as yet shadowy coalition, who might choose this moment to flex their muscles. They stood, assault rifles at the ready, waiting.

Outside, the onlookers also waited. Gigantic speaker systems had been set up so that imams could address the crowd and guide them in prayer. The queue of such imams seemed endless. Everyone wanted a go: not to have done so might be disastrous politically, depending on how things turned out. They fought to outdo each other in the depth of their despair, the sincerity of their hope. Some, when they got to the mic, had to be practically dragged from it.

Against this background, Imam Boraqashti’s speech, when he delivered it, was jarringly short. A man who craved influence but hated the exposure that came with it, he spoke only a few brief sentences in the same reluctant, mumbling monotone he used for all public addresses. And then he stalked off, briskly, head bowed, without a word to anyone else.

His brevity astonished the other robed men around him, but they knew better than to question it. Imam Boraqashti’s reputation was well-established. He was by nature slow, careful, deliberate; seeing him move quickly sent alarm bells ringing. Nobody got in his way.

---

\noindent Malaf was near enough to the hospital to hear the amplified voices of the imams, but not so close that she could identify the speakers or make out any words. Occasionally one of the helicopters circled lower to get a better look at the crowd. Whenever that happened, she pulled the headscarf further forward, making her less identifiable from above. It was an unnecessary precaution, probably, but she was already nervous about being exposed to so many men and women at once. She had no idea how many people were looking for her, or how widely her photograph had been circulated.

She didn’t want to be here. At any moment an announcement might be made that would make this hospital the epicentre of a riot, or even a *coup d’etat*; and yet here she was, walking right through it.

Of course, as a lifelong Ez Raamer with a map of the city indelibly printed on the inside of her skull, she must have known that the long walk from Ropeeri-Teshar metro station to the Grand Astihari Hotel would take her past the hospital. She was also aware that around Blessed Martyrs, the gathering of well-wishers (or very proactive mourners, who’d turned up early to secure a good spot) was by now in the tens of thousands; the state-owned news, which was the only television channel still broadcasting during the media shutdown, had little else to report on except the size the crowd and the security measures in place to prevent trouble.

But these two facts – that a) there existed a huge concentration of policemen, soldiers and Guards outside the hospital, and b) that she was heading straight for it – had somehow failed to mesh in her head, despite her awareness of each fact individually. Now she was confronted with a situation she should have seen a mile off, but hadn’t.

It had been exactly the same with Mr Obid.

She thought about Mr Obid now: the PetRaam employee who’d contacted the Big Q gang to leak documents about the missing oil rig. Leafing through Qaseh’s dossier on the way to Ez Nezeshti, she had amused herself by trying to picture him, what he looked like. A technical man, methodical, organised. Quiet, but with a rebellious streak. She saw him in a white shirt with a name tag on it – not actually saying ‘Obid’, which was doubtless a pseudonym – and a neatly knotted stripy tie. She’d also given him glasses and bad skin, because, well, why not?

Even though she had had all the facts, and should therefore have been able to figure it out long ago, it simply hadn’t clicked that Mr Obid was Lineh.

Malaf had little idea how companies like RaamCo Construction Finance worked, but knew they dealt with the money matters of big government-sponsored works like PetRaam’s Hydrocarbon Extraction project. Documents would have passed through her office, maybe on the way to the shredder. Lineh had noticed something, some anomaly, and had been lucky enough to work out its implications before blurting it out to anyone who would get her in trouble. Probably she hadn’t been able to see who had pocketed the money – if she had, ‘Mr Obid’ would have mentioned it – but the fact that an entire oil rig had simply disappeared, and that efforts had been made to cover it up, was explosive enough.

What, Malaf asked herself, had made her want to expose it? Was it, she wondered, a bizarre kind of atonement? Once upon a time, Lineh had betrayed a colleague, and even years later she felt the guilt of that betrayal; it surfaced periodically, haunting her nightmares. There was nothing she could do to undo her actions; but maybe she felt that, by doing this one good thing, she could go some way to settling the score, if not with her old colleague, then at least with the wider cosmos.

Or maybe the desire had always been there. For all Malaf knew, the Ramestani construction industry was so rife with corruption that documents this inflammatory came Lineh’s way every other week. To make her act *this* time, when every other time she had done nothing, all that had changed was *opportunity*. Before meeting Malaf, Lineh had no idea how to make the documents public. But now she knew how, because Malaf had told her.

The cryptic note in her diary: *Q*. In a moment of madness Malaf had thought it meant Qaseh. Ironically, in a roundabout way, it had. But when Lineh wrote it, it hadn’t stood for Qaseh. His name had never been mentioned. It stood for Big Q. That was the day she sought them out. Made contact. Gave them the documents.

Bragging about her shady past in bed that night, Malaf had done everything but give Lineh their email address – and that wouldn’t have been hard to find, if one knew where to look.

Lineh, who flew kites, played good backgammon and was lousy at French; who hated her job, loved white chocolate and marked her page by folding the corner down. Malaf had known enough to love her, yet knew nothing at all. Even now she was full of surprises.

---

\noindent The Grand Astihari Hotel had done well out of the war. While every building around it had been pounded to gravel by rocket blasts, by some extraordinary stroke of luck it had survived with everything intact but its windows. After the hostilities had petered out it became the main venue for the diplomats and entrepreneurs flying in to help rebuild the nation. More recently, embassy closures and import/export sanctions had dried up much of that revenue stream, but if the hotel was struggling to make ends meet, it hid it well. Most of its lifts worked most of the time, and the usual airborne Ez Raami grime was pressure-washed off its lower stories at least twice a year.

Would anybody here be able to identify her? She doubted it. Never mind that the people staffing her father’s party were probably not on shift this afternoon: she herself was unrecognisable. The Malaf who had walked through its front door only a few days ago had been well-dressed and confident, hiding her awkwardness as efficiently as she had learned to hide so much else of her life. Now she was transformed: bruised, exhausted, emotionally shattered. She would not have recognised her own reflection.

Malaf stood outside the front entrance, trying to retrace the path she’d taken as she’d fled the hotel. It wasn’t hard to remember. Those few moments had been burned permanently into her: the fear; fingers still palpable from the grip they’d made over her mouth, cutting off the scream. That night, she had thought it was impossible to feel more scared.

But that had been before Ez Nezeshti.

The hotel occupied one half of a city block. Malaf walked briskly around it, away from its main entrance, past the place where valets came to meet incoming cars. Soon she was near the back of the building, where the unattractive architectural gubbins necessary to make a building work – keep it cool, supply it with water and gas and high-speed internet and so on – made the usual ungainly mesh with Ez Raam’s infrastructure. Pipes emerged from the walls to connect to other pipes emerging from the street, typically meeting in an unholy mass of shapeless metal where welders had looked at each pipe, found neither one to have a standard diameter, and had had to improvise the kind of join they’d never tell their kids about. Vents spewed steam that stank of fried food and carpet cleaner. The place hummed with electricity.

It looked different in the daytime. Malaf spent a few moments trying to remember which way she had come, where she had paused. *Here*, in front of this structure: a big, gently vibrating box with thickly insulated high-voltage cabling going in and coming out. She had no idea what it was or how safe it was to touch.

She got down on her hands and knees and felt around in the filthy, dark space beneath the box. Eventually she found what she was looking for and pulled it out.

Her dictaphone.

---

\noindent A black van whose sides were marked with Guard insignia tore down the streets of Ez Raam.

When they had come for Malaf’s father, he had lasted longer than most, refusing to leave the office until he knew who had sent them. Anyone else they would simply have dragged from the chair at gunpoint, but Qoshoor Sagheedi was a politician. He had powerful friends, or thought he had. In the interests of time, they had decided to let him know how little that mattered.

“*Imam Boraqashti* was most insistent, Dr Sagheedi.”

It had the desired effect. Sagheedi gave the bearded lieutenant one final glare and then went to get his coat.

Even with sirens blaring to clear the traffic, it still took over forty minutes to reach their destination. Looking out through windows that were so tinted they were nearly opaque, Sagheedi was only dimly aware of his surroundings. Now they were being waved through a security barrier. Now they were descending into an underground parking lot.

A few minutes later he found himself in a small, wood-panelled waiting room. The only place to sit was a severe-looking wooden chair, all right-angles and sharp edges, which would have done well as either an exhibit in a design museum or else as an instrument of torture; in any case it wasn’t much good for sitting on. So he stood, hands clasped behind his back, making a show of his impatience and boredom for the benefit of any concealed cameras. From his customary portrait on the wall, the Supreme Leader glowered down on him.

The door of the waiting room was opened by a young woman wrapped in a black gown.

“Thank you for waiting,” Isaha said. “Come this way, please, sir.”

“Oh, let’s not rush,” Sagheedi said sarcastically. “I’m enjoying this break from the office.”

This might have been Isaha’s cue to apologise on her employer’s behalf. The fact that she did not do so, and merely smiled at him, was another reminder of where Sagheedi stood in the grand scheme of things. Sighing, he followed her out of the room and up the stairs.

Isaha led him to an unmarked door, and stepped aside, head bowed. It was another meaningful gesture: Sagheedi might think himself a big shot, but in this house he did his own knocking. Feeling his anxiety beginning to return, he rapped a knuckle on the polished wood – gently, as though wary of waking someone.

If there was a reply, Sagheedi didn’t hear it, but Isaha, who presumably in the years of working here had developed superhuman hearing, inclined her head subtly. *You’d better not keep him waiting,* the look said.

Sagheedi had never spoken to Boraqashti before, but knew his face, just as everyone else did. He was an ever-present ghost in the machinery of Ramestani power. Like a distant planet, he was generally only detectable by his effect on those around him: the way conversations trailed off when people knew he was approaching; the way even other senior clergy tended to glance around furtively before speaking his name out loud.

Sagheedi knew powerful people, knew their habits. He was expecting to step into the office and find the old man busy reading some document. Sagheedi would have to stand there, waiting, while Boraqashti ignored him. The silence would be carefully tailored to intimidate him even further. Only after enough time had passed for Sagheedi to feel truly frightened would the old man finally acknowledge his presence. It was a cliché, rather tired by now, but Sagheedi would endure it for form’s sake.

He was, for that reason, caught off-guard when he entered the room and found the imam staring straight at him with a look of outright loathing.

“I hear things, Sagheedi,” Boraqashti rasped. The man had a reputation for shyness, but right now he was staring right into Sagheedi’s eyes, unblinking, through his grimy spectacles. “I hear you hosted a party at the Grand Astihari Hotel a few days ago.”

If this was a reference to Boraqashti’s network of spies and informers, generally held to be vast and unimaginably diligent, Sagheedi wasn’t sure how to take it. The event had, after all, been public knowledge. Many of its guests had posted about it on their illicit social media accounts. But Sagheedi guessed that such things took a while to trickle down to Boraqashti, who was probably only dimly aware of what social media was. “It was to celebrate my twentieth year in Fisheries and Aquaculture. Hardly an earth-shattering event, but a few friends suggested that I—”

“Who was there?”

Sagheedi smiled slightly. “You must already know some names.”

“*Ebri Hoz.*”

“Ebri was good enough to come along.” The rivalry between Hoz and Boraqashti was well known, but he didn’t consider himself to have been tainted by it, so he continued. “We knew each other slightly in university, and he—”

“Did he speak with your daughter?”

Once, when he had been a young man, Sagheedi had been on a sailing boat far from land. He’d been sitting on its edge, enjoying a precious, smuggled-in bottle of beer, when he’d suddenly lost his balance and fallen head-first into the water. That was what this moment felt like: an explosion sounding in his head, then the world falling away into muffled silence. That instant of free-fall before the panic set in.

For a long time he didn’t speak. “What is this about?” he finally said, his voice barely audible.

Boraqashti blinked and looked away suddenly, as if the strain of staring directly into another person’s eyes for so long had exhausted him.

“What happened at that party, Sagheedi?” he demanded. “What did she do?”

## I

Malaf got awkwardly out of the taxi. Her shoes, though devastatingly beautiful, were a pain to walk in, and she’d taken them off in the cab; now her exit onto the street involved a lot of undignified hopping. She caught the driver smirking at her and gave him the finger as he drove off. Then, regaining some of her composure, she smoothed down her dress and crossed the threshold into the Grand Astihari Hotel.

The last time Malaf had shown face at one of her father’s events, it had been on the rooftop of his own place of work. The crew he’d hired had done their best with the food and lighting, but it had felt like what it was: a slightly upscale office party, held out in the open only because doing it downstairs would have meant unplugging and finding temporary homes for heavy-duty photocopiers that nobody was sure how to turn back on again. Contrast this with the Grand Astihari: its thick crimson rugs, its glittering chandeliers, its quietly efficient porters in uniform. Qoshoor Sagheedi had clearly gone up in the world.

She went to the reception desk and waited for attention. The space behind the desk was strung with flags of all nations, or almost all: the major imposers of economic sanctions were notably absent. A small bowl of complimentary mints sat next to the bell. She took one when she reached the front of the queue and popped it in her mouth.

“Good evening. I’m here for Qoshoor Sagheedi’s party,” Malaf told the man behind the desk.

“Name, please?”

“Malaf Sagheedi.”

He checked it against a long list of guests. Malaf, being Malaf, sniffed information, and craned forward slightly so she could get a better look at it. The man noticed this and pointedly tilted the printed side of the paper out of view.

“Your name is on the list.” He put a barely perceptible emphasis on the *is*, making it reek of disapproval. “The eighth floor, ma’am. The lifts are on the left, over there.”

“Oh, so the lifts are actually working today?”

“I do hope you enjoy your evening, Miss Sagheedi.”

“I will try.” She helped herself to another mint from the bowl, making sure she had a good stir around with her finger, just to be unpleasant. As she headed for the lifts she made a mental note. *On way out: distract man, steal list.*

On the eighth floor Malaf followed the signs marked SAGHEEDI. Her father had booked the main dining hall. Soon enough she was standing in front of its double doors, which were open. Between her and the doors were two men in dark suits.

“Bag inspection, ma’am,” one told her.

“Looking for anything particular?”

“It’s the rules, ma’am.”

Malaf gave him the Raised Eyebrow. “I wonder what my father would say about that?”

“Unless your father’s name is Ebri Hoz, ma’am, it won’t matter.”

Well, it had been worth a try.

Hoz’s goons went through her handbag, giving it much more than just a cursory look. It turned out they were looking for phones: when they found hers they gave her an apologetic look. “No cameras tonight, ma’am. I’m afraid you’ll have to leave this with us.”

“No selfies with Mr Hoz?”

“No, ma’am.”

“Pity. It could be worth something when he’s President.”

“Nobody’s saying he’ll run,” the man on the right said, giving her a wink. She liked this one. “You can collect it on your way out. Enjoy your evening.”

Malaf shrugged, and stepped through the open doors.

---

\noindent “I’m so glad you decided to come,” her father said, taking both Malaf’s hands in his.

“It’s your big day, Dad,” Malaf replied, kissing him on the cheek. “I wouldn’t want to miss it.”

Qoshoor Sagheedi smiled to show that he was choosing to take this obvious untruth at face value. “It’s so good to see you. When was the last time?”

Malaf had to think about it. “Too long ago,” she admitted.

“You must tell me everything you’ve been up to.”

“Believe me, you don’t want to know.”

He laughed, but with an edge to it that suggested he would be taking *this* at face value too. “Come, there are some people I’d like you to meet.”

Malaf adroitly pinched a canapé from a passing waiter, then slipped her arm through her father’s and allowed herself to be led through the crowd.

The dining hall was spacious and softly lit by the low sunlight slanting through the windows. There were two long tables for the guests to eat at, and a raised platform with an enormous cake on it. Beside this was a projection screen and a lectern; on seeing them Malaf abandoned all hope, and resigned herself to an evening of boring speeches.

She fixed a smile to her face as her father introduced her to people, mostly other minor politicians and their wives. Malaf made the appropriate noises, trying only half-heartedly to learn names. Meanwhile she was scanning the faces. She noted that Hoz himself hadn’t arrived yet. Having his own security team precede was evidently meant to signal how important he was, how many flunkeys he had to spare.

“Ah, Asram,” her father said to a man standing to one side. “So good of you to join us tonight. Have you met my daughter?”

Malaf half-turned to see who he was talking to, and it was fortunate that she hadn’t chosen that moment to sip her drink or pop a nibble into her mouth, because the shock of seeing Lineh’s boss standing right in front of her would have surely caused an accident. She thought: *ohhh crap.*

Asram Tarseech was holding a glass of fruit juice in one hand and a plate in another, leaving neither hand free. He looked momentarily dumbfounded to see Malaf, but an onlooker would have written it off as him struggling to work out the logistics of shaking this woman’s hand. “I... do believe I have,” he said carefully. “Malaf, isn’t it?”

One small blessing: at least when she’d spoken to him in Lineh’s office, she’d given him her real name. “A pleasure to see you again, Mr Tarseech,” Malaf said, bowing slightly in place of a handshake. *Now shut the hell up and walk away.*

But her father, oblivious, wasn’t going to let this lie. “Good heavens, you know each other? Asram, I only met you myself a few months ago!”

Tarseech nodded. Anybody politically sharp enough to have been invited to this sort of party had long ago learned to think quickly. “Yes. If I recall, Malaf offered to do some translation work for us. Since we get so little demand for English these days I’m afraid I had to turn her down.”

Malaf could have hugged him. “All lies, of course,” she told her father cheerfully. “The truth is, I asked way too high a price.”

“Who knows,” Tarseech replied evenly. “Maybe we’ll be able to strike some kind of bargain.”

“Yes,” Malaf said. “We must talk later.”

Tarseech excused himself, and father and daughter continued with their introductions. Malaf, suddenly parched, drained her glass and swapped the empty for a full one plucked from a table top. She turned to her father. In these heels, she was nearly as tall as he was. “Are you and Mr Tarseech close?” she asked.

“Not even slightly,” Qoshoor Sagheedi said, smiling and waving at a nearby couple out of earshot.

“So why did you invite him?”

“Politics,” he sighed. “People want a reason to meet. Talk, scheme, plot. It’s my party, of course – twenty long years, *et cetera* – but I might as well not even be here.”

As he said this, Malaf’s father sounded very old, and very tired. It didn’t suit him. Malaf gave his arm a squeeze. The rare gesture of affection took Sagheedi by surprise.

“So,” Malaf asked. “If not you, who is all of this *really* meant for?”

The question was well-timed. At that instant they became aware that all heads had turned towards the dining hall’s main entrance. Standing there was a figure Malaf recognised immediately.

Primed though she was to remark how much shorter, balder, fatter and so on he looked in real life, she was actually struck by how slickly similar Hoz was to his on-screen persona. As ever when seeing a famous person in the flesh for the first time, there was a kind of unreality to it, as though he had stepped through a wormhole from TV-land to mingle with these mere mortals. He shook hands, smiled self-deprecatingly, greeted people by name. He exuded the friendly, honest, open warmth that one only ever saw in genuinely good people – or else outright psychopaths.

Guests gathered around this rising star, drawn to him by a force in proportion to how much they felt their own careers would rise by association with him. Ebri Hoz thanked them for coming here tonight as if the party was his own. It was some time before the Sagheedis got their turn, but Hoz singled out her father for special treatment.

“Qoshoor Sagheedi,” he said, throwing an arm around the man’s shoulders. “It’s so very, *very* good to see you again, old friend.”

“Ebri,” Sagheedi said with a smile. “It’s been too long.”

“And surely this angel must be your daughter?” Hoz asked, gesturing to Malaf. “Malaf, isn’t it? Good heavens. The last time I saw you must have been before your father joined the ministry.”

“Mr Hoz,” Malaf said, bowing politely.

“You’re the spitting image of your mother,” Hoz told her. “Another very beautiful woman.” He put his hand affectionately on Malaf’s arm, a gesture between an unmarried man and woman which, in certain public places, could have got him arrested. No wonder there were no cameras allowed in here, Malaf thought. The feel of the man’s hand on her made her skin crawl.

“Now, Qoshoor,” Hoz said, turning to her father. “I’m very glad that your generous invitation allowed me to bring not just my own sinful self, but the real brains of the family. Have you met my sister, Shosa?”

Hoz indicated a severe-looking woman dressed in black who was standing rigidly behind him. She had been scanning the faces in the room wearing a look of unalloyed contempt, and this did not change when she greeted the Sagheedis. Malaf wondered what they had done to deserve such a look, but as the evening went by she realised it was nothing personal; it was merely the default expression of a woman who had presumably never once in her life found something worth smiling at. Shosa Hoz offered her hand for shaking in a way that suggested she would feel the need to wash it soon after.

“Delighted,” was the only word she spoke to Malaf.

“Shosa’s here to make sure I don’t say or do anything that’ll get me in trouble,” Hoz said, smiling. “Nothing that might...” He made a show of searching for anyone who might be spying on him. “...*ruin my chances.*”

“Your chances of *what*, Ebri?” Qoshoor asked dutifully, as if there could be any doubt.

“You’ll find out soon enough, old friend,” Hoz said with a wink. “Maybe... maybe even tonight...”

And then he excused himself, Shosa following close behind.

---

\noindent After a few more excruciating minutes of circulating among the guests, Malaf decided that, when she left tonight, she would go straight to Qaseh’s apartment, and murder him for persuading her to come here.

Out of habit she reached into her bag to check her mobile – praying for a notification that would distract her for a few moments – then remembered it had been taken at the door. The only phone on view belonged to Hoz’s assistant, a man whose name she’d caught as Fazem. He seemed practically glued to the device, sending emails, updating a calendar with new events, barely keeping up with his boss’s effortless schmoozing. Occasionally Hoz would call him over to take a photo of a particularly important handshake, and Fazem would dutifully snap and tweet. Malaf felt a strange kinship with the poor man: at least there was *someone* here as miserable as she was.

Shortly after Hoz’s arrival – because, it was now clear, he was the one everyone had been waiting for – dinner was served. As the guests took their seats at the long tables, Malaf tried to engineer things so she would end up near her father. She was too slow, however: Qoshoor Sagheedi took the head of the table, Hoz sat down beside him, and everyone else scrambled to be nearby. Malaf found herself displaced into a seat at the unfashionable end of the room, where she poured herself a large cup of fruit juice, carefully ignoring the other nobodies she had ended up surrounded by.

At least the food was good.

As she ate, she became aware that Tarseech – who through some deft manoeuvring had ended up sitting close to Hoz himself – was watching her closely. Once, their eyes met. Tarseech held the gaze for long enough for something to pass between them – that he knew that she knew that he knew that she knew – before looking away, and resuming a conversation with Hoz.

She thought back to their meeting a few days ago. What had they talked about? Lineh being off sick from work, not answering her phone. He said he would send someone to drop by her house and see if she was home. Was that what he wanted to say? What had he found out?

---

\noindent There were speeches; of course there were. An old man told long and rambling stories about Sagheedi’s first day at work, recited an anecdote or two that drew polite laughs from a few former colleagues. Malaf slouched deeper into her chair, staring at a distant clock and willing its hands to turn faster.

Either the man’s words had trailed off into silence or else Malaf had briefly lapsed into a boredom-induced coma, because the applause, when it came, made her jump. With effort Malaf pulled herself upright in her seat and joined in. Her father was ascending to the podium. He shook the old man’s hand warmly, and smiles passed between them; but Malaf could see the tiredness underneath. Qoshoor Sagheedi wanted to be there as little as she did. He gripped the sides of the lectern and blinked at the guests beneath him. His eyes briefly met Malaf’s, or seemed to. She smiled for him. *Hang in there, Dad.*

“Hello again, Malaf.”

The whisper was so close it startled her. Malaf turned sharply to see Tarseech standing right behind her. “A word, privately?” he asked.

“This really isn’t the best time,” Malaf whispered back, keeping her eyes on her father.

“Appreciated,” Tarseech replied, his voice quiet but firm, and urgent. “But it has its advantages.”

“As in, nobody will notice we’re gone?”

“Mm. I’ll be in the meeting room, through that door, on the left.”

“Why so secretive, Mr Tarseech?”

Everyone was smiling at a joke Sagheedi had made, so Tarseech smiled too. “It’s about Lineh,” he said.

With that, Tarseech excused himself and walked away.

Malaf watched her father speak for a few more moments. Then she sighed, got up from her seat at the table, and followed.

---

\noindent She left the dining hall through its main entrance, nodding to Hoz’s man, who was sitting at a small table keeping guard of the confiscated mobiles and looking bored. He was alone.

“Where’s your friend?” Malaf asked.

“Oh, he quit, ma’am,” the man replied deadpan. “Security just wasn’t what he wanted to do with his life.”

“Good for him. What’ll he do now?”

“He told me he might run for President.”

Malaf shrugged. “I guess they let anyone do it, these days. Did you see a man—”

“That way, ma’am.”

Malaf went where he pointed. The corridor gave access to a number of meeting rooms. One door was half-open.

The room was set up with a conference table, a projection screen and a number of comfortable-looking swivel chairs, but Tarseech wasn’t sitting in any of them. It was a movement of roller-blinds in the breeze that gave him away: drawn half-way down to darken the room for a recent slide show, they partially concealed a balcony one could step out onto through a glass door.

Malaf pushed the blind aside and went out onto the balcony. The evening air was hotter than the air-conditioned interior. It tasted of ozone and car exhaust.

Tarseech and Malaf spent a long moment sizing one another up. He was a big man, broad-shouldered and tall; but he looked ill, like he’d taken a punch in the guts. In his hand he was fidgeting with a small rectangle of white card. It took Malaf a few moments to recognise it as one of her own business cards – the one she’d given him when they last met.

“We probably don’t have long,” Tarseech noted.

Malaf nodded agreement. “So: what’s on your mind, Mr Tarseech?”

---

\noindent Qoshoor Sagheedi, never one for speeches, would rather have been elsewhere. Nobody was really listening – which was convenient, because in a sense he wasn’t really speaking. His voice, an automatic drone of platitudes, conveyed no meaningful information. Former colleagues were remembered and thanked. Minor achievements were catalogued. His audience smiled politely as they enjoyed this brief interlude between bouts of networking, deal-making, and scheming.

Sagheedi was a private man. Survival in Ramestani politics meant keeping one’s personal life behind a brick wall. Open any holes in that wall, show any hint of a family, friends, hobbies, and other things might also be exposed. The winemaking kit gathering dust in his basement. The packs of playing cards. The collection of Hollywood movies, black-market, uncensored. Better to show nothing than risk showing too much.

But *she* was here, and so tonight would be an exception.

“And lastly, and most importantly, I would like to thank my family,” he said. “Thank, and perhaps ask for forgiveness, for all the times my work has called me away from my duties as parent. Family...”

He looked up at Malaf’s end of the table. He saw her chair; saw that it was empty.

“...is everything.”

---

\noindent “You did tell me your name was Sagheedi,” Tarseech said, “but I didn’t know you were *Qoshoor’s* daughter.”

“They do say I look more like my mother.”

“Hmm. So what were you really doing in my office, Malaf?”

“Exactly what I said,” Malaf explained. “I was looking for Lineh. I’d tried every other way of contacting her. I thought maybe someone from her work could help.”

“Well, she’s off sick, as I said before.”

“You also said you’d send someone to go to her house,” Malaf reminded him. “Did you?”

Tarseech hesitated, wondering what to do. What he settled on was, apparently, to tell the truth. “No.”

“Probably for the best,” Malaf told him. “It would have been crowded with me there too.”

“Oh,” he said, seeming surprised. “*You* went to see her?”

“Yes. Late last night.”

“And?” he asked.

“She wasn’t home,” Malaf told him.

“Maybe she didn’t hear you knock.”

“It’s true she didn’t answer the door,” Malaf said, “but since I wanted to be absolutely certain, I went in anyway.”

Tarseech stared at her incredulously. “You broke into her house?”

Malaf kept her expression carefully neutral.

Tarseech looked at her levelly for several long seconds, evidently going through some sort of reassessment of Malaf’s threat level – revising it upwards, probably for the fourth or fifth time since they first met. “That’s a lot of danger,” he remarked, “and a lot of effort, for a translator to put in for just a client. You two must know each other pretty well, right?”

“You could say that.”

“Hmm. This puts me in a difficult position,” Tarseech said slowly. “You see, *I* know Lineh pretty well too. Well enough for her to have told me something in confidence. Something she hasn’t told anybody else, as far as I know. I probably shouldn’t be telling you, but at the same time I get the impression you’ll find it out yourself eventually. You don’t strike me as the sort of person who’d let a puzzle go unsolved.”

“I’m listening.”

“I mentioned it before: in the days leading up to Lineh calling in sick, she’d seemed distracted. Worried by something.”

“You told me you didn’t know what,” Malaf said, but having seen what Lineh had been writing in her diary, she felt she was a lot closer to the answer.

“Well, that was a lie,” Tarseech said. He sighed.

Malaf felt she already knew what he was going to say next. So his next words, when they came, caught her somewhat off-guard.

“The truth is, Lineh isn’t really sick. She’s in love.”

---

\noindent Hoz had sat through Sagheedi’s speech, smiling and laughing without hearing a single word over the roaring of his own heartbeat. It had been almost impossible to sit still. *Tonight,* he kept thinking. *It would begin tonight*.

He thought about the years of work that had led up to this moment. How much he had sacrificed. The pain, the difficult decisions, the sleepless nights. He had worked so hard, fighting his way up from the bottom of the pile. A decade on the Purity Board: ten years of his life wasted, with nothing to show for it but an address book full of people who owed him favours. He’d met people, made connections. And all through it, he’d waited.

Every election season he’d dreamed of it: of seeing his own name on the list of candidates for President of the Republic of Ramestan.

For the whole of his adult life he’d shaken the right hands, formed the right alliances, swapped sides at just the right times. All he’d needed was money. Well, he had plenty now. Plenty – but not enough. Enough to buy his way out of the scandal, buy a vote, silence a newspaper, crush an enemy or two – but even with all the money in the world, victory was far from guaranteed.

All he had bought was a shot at the big prize. It would be his one chance.

And it would begin right here, right now.

Sagheedi was finishing up. Hoz joined in with the applause, chipped in a cheerful “Bravo!” of his own. Smiling – a little sadly, it seemed to Hoz – Sagheedi took a step back from the lectern, and bowed gently, acknowledging the applause. Then, as per their arrangement – a quick favour Hoz had asked, one old friend to another – Sagheedi returned to the microphone.

“And now – thank you, yes, thank you – and now, I believe there is a gentleman here who would like to say a few words which, I am told, will not be entirely about me.” Polite laughter; expectant. “Ebri?”

Suddenly light-headed as though drunk, Ebri Hoz got to his feet. One quick glance along the table. He picked out the faces of Shosa and Fazem, looking for any sign of warning or disapproval. Fazem smiled encouragingly; Shosa looked mildly disgusted, which was her baseline setting and signalled an all clear.

Taking a deep breath, Hoz ascended.

---

\noindent Malaf’s mouth had gone dry. She made herself speak, though her voice sounded strange, unlike her own. “In love?”

Tarseech shrugged a little, looking out over the city. “That’s what she told me, in the office one evening. I asked her if anything was new in her life, and she hesitated a bit, but then she told me: she was seeing someone.” A quick sidelong glance, to see whether Malaf was shocked by this, or might perhaps be pretending to be shocked to reaffirm that she had simply *no idea* that nice girls got up to such improper things. If so, there would be little point in taking the conversation any further. One look at Malaf’s expression was enough for him. “Obviously this all had to be kept secret. It meant a lot to me that she trusted me enough to tell me.”

“When was this?”

“About a month ago.”

Malaf nodded slowly, absorbing this. Her head was pounding. “But something went wrong?”

“I don’t know the details. Apparently it didn’t work out between them. I don’t know who ended it, but Lineh came out of it feeling awful. She couldn’t keep her mind on her work. I went down to the photocopying room and I found her there in tears, and that was when she told me it had ended. I told her to take the day off. She did. The next morning she told me she needed to get away for a bit. And that was the last time we spoke.”

Everything around Malaf had taken on a new, eye-shredding sharpness. Everything high contrast and abstracted. She looked up at Tarseech and tried to stop her head spinning. “Have you heard from her since?”

“No,” he said. “I called her at her home one evening. No answer. You say she’s not home. Well, there could be any reason for that. Maybe she’s gone on a short break somewhere, to clear her head. Who knows – maybe they’ve got back together.”

“They haven’t got back together,” Malaf said, quietly.

Tarseech shrugged. “But it has been a few days now,” he went on. “And, to be honest, I’m starting to get worried for her. If you’re still interested in tracking her down... well, perhaps that will point you in the right direction.”

Malaf nodded again. “Thank you,” she said.

“You’re welcome,” Tarseech said. And then, doing everything he could to be helpful, he added, “I can’t remember what she said the man’s name was. Yiras? Yonas? Something like that.”

Malaf blinked, twice. Everything seemed to have gone quiet.

“She told you his name, huh?” she eventually said, speaking slowly and calmly.

“Yes.”

“Lineh’s boyfriend.”

“She said she was crazy about him.”

“I see,” Malaf said, quietly. “Young people today, huh?”

He said something in reply, but by this point Malaf wasn’t really listening. *Asram Tarseech, you lying sack of garbage...*

The story Tarseech had just told her was masterful. It was a narrative perfectly tailored a country where everybody had one face presented to the world and another kept carefully hidden. A story of secret romance and hidden motivations, there was not a person alive in Ramestan who would not relate to it. He had added enough details to make it real, but kept it vague enough to lead an investigation in any direction but back towards himself.

It hadn’t come out of nowhere. It had been thought out, long in advance, then fleshed out and redrafted, and rehearsed, many times, so that he could deliver an absolutely knock-down performance whenever the police, or the Guard, or a friend or relative of Lineh came along asking questions.

She stared at the back of Tarseech’s head and considered what she would need to do to get off this balcony and away from this man. The answer was obvious: thank him for his help, tell him she’d do her best to find this boyfriend – ask him to repeat the name, or list of names, just to make sure she had it right – then retreat carefully into the conference room, head out through the door. She would retrieve her telephone from the bouncers. Once safely out of the hotel, she would find a quiet spot and make a call, arranging a convenient time, ideally even tonight, to make a full statement to the police.

This is what a sane person would have done.

But rather than doing this, Malaf instead said, quite clearly and somewhat louder than she’d expected in order to make herself heard over the blood rushing through her ears: “Lineh wrote in her diary that someone was following her. Stalking her. That was you, wasn’t it?”

At this point Tarseech had his back to her. In the low scatter of light coming from the city, subtle changes in his posture were hard to make out. If he reacted at all, it was not by moving. By ceasing to move, maybe.

“She wrote about you. The way you were obsessed with her. She wrote about it right until the night she vanished. The night...” Malaf swallowed; said it. “The night you killed her.”

Still nothing. She considered their relative positions on the balcony: she was closest to the door. If he wanted off, it would have to be through her.

“She had a name for you,” she told him. “She called you Mr Starfish.”

Faster than she could react Tarseech was in motion. He spun around, throwing his whole bodyweight into an open-handed punch to Malaf’s face. In spite of everything it caught Malaf off-guard, and the force of it was immense – but the movement was instinctual, poorly thought-out. He hadn’t judged the distance well, hadn’t closed a fist. It ended up more shove than punch, but it sent her staggering backwards, tripping over her idiotic high heels, spinning around. It was Tarseech himself who saved her from falling: he grabbed her from behind, one big hand clamping hard over her mouth, pulling her head back, exposing her bare throat. Another arm around her waist, pinning her against him. She hadn’t even had time to cry out.

Now he was dragging her backwards across the balcony, further from the open doorway. She kicked out and lost a shoe, flinging it out into space. It arced through the air and disappeared over the wall of the balcony, falling several storeys – and Malaf understood, then, that if Tarseech had his way something similar would happen to her.

Tarseech was a strong man, but having to keep one hand over Malaf’s mouth meant his hold on her was awkward. Malaf was being yanked off-balance; she figured that if she could brace herself against something solid she might be able to wriggle free. She kicked off her other shoe, then tried with both feet to get a purchase on the floor, or the wall of the balcony as it went by.

Tarseech grunted, tugged her harder. She was light enough, and him tall enough, for him to lift her completely off the ground – but not without getting a better grip. He shifted his arm up from her waist to somewhere further up her chest.

And there he froze.

He froze because he had felt something under Malaf’s dress that made no sense. Hard, sharp-edged, flat: it was almost as if there was something taped to her body.

Some kind of listening device.

Horrified incomprehension flooded him. What the hell was going on? Had this entire situation been engineered by her? Had he fallen into some sort of trap? Was it recording them now? Was it *transmitting?*

He was so confused that for a split second he let his guard down, and his grip over Malaf’s mouth loosened. This was her chance to scream. She didn’t scream.

She bit.

Tarseech yelped in pain as Malaf’s teeth sank into the pad of flesh at the top of one finger. She clamped her jaw tight on it as if she might have to dangle from it. Tarseech thrashed manically, and for what felt like an eternity for both of them Tarseech was able to maintain his grip on Malaf while Malaf kept up her own grip on his finger. Then one more flailing wriggle separated them, and Malaf was thrown off Tarseech’s body, with almost enough force to pitch her over the side of the balcony.

Malaf turned the impact into a bounce, and spun away from the low wall. She caught a glimpse of Tarseech, who for an instant had forgotten her as he stared at his bloody hand. Malaf was by the door leading inside, and wasted no time. She turned and ran.

Tarseech looked up from his injury and launched himself at her – then tripped on one of Malaf’s discarded shoes. He stumbled against the floor-to-ceiling windows, his hand leaving smears of blood on the glass as he fell. Then he was up again and surging forward after her, panting.

\noindent Hoz’s speaking style was well known by now: jokey, informal, off-the-cuff. He moved his hands around a lot. People mocked him online for that, swapping gifs of him conducting orchestras, or directing taxiing airplanes. Good: it meant they were learning who he was. He’d silence these jokers later, when he had the power to; but for now, they were better publicity than he could have hoped for, even if it wasn’t under his control.

This moment, though – *this* he controlled.

Only one version of his announcement would exist: the one Fazem was recording now. Hoz checked to make sure the man’s phone was up and filming. A professional camera crew would have sent the wrong message. Too slick, too *establishment*. No, that would never do for Ebri Hoz. Ebri Hoz was *one of us.* People had watched him rise from nothing, and would watch him continue to rise – and would do so completely unaware of the planning, the image management, the *money*, that lay behind it. Nothing was more expensive to buy than grassroots support; nothing harder to engineer than spontaneous outbursts of love.

Hoz beamed at the crowd. Not a single one of them had any doubt about what was coming next. But he would keep them in suspense just a minute longer.

“I just want to say a few words tonight,” he said, “about my old friend Qoshoor Sagheedi, and all the good work he’s done over the years...”

He spoke, and the audience listened, waiting tolerantly as these niceties were laid out. Hoz felt them incrementally shifting edgewards on their seats. *Come on,* he knew they were thinking. *Just say it...* He laughed lightly, exulting in the moment. Any minute now.

A single electronic *ping* sounded quite loudly in the dining hall.

Hoz did his best to talk through his irritation. It could only have come from that idiot Fazem’s phone, the one doing the filming. Had he not told Fazem *specifically* to turn off any notifications when he was recording this speech? He glanced over at the man, who at least had enough brain cells to realise what a mistake he’d made. Fazem looked shocked, concerned. Good. Hoz made a mental note to have him shot when he was President.

Except...

Hoz watched from the corner of his eye in ever-increasing exasperation. Now Fazem was fiddling with the thing, probably adjusting its settings or something. No, Fazem, *don’t* try to turn notifications off now. Accept your mistake, resign yourself to your impending doom, and *hold the damn phone steady*.

Hoz realised he’d stopped speaking. He rushed his next words before the pause became too long. “And one thing old Qoshoor and I have in common is this: loyalty. Loyalty to our great nation.”

He looked at Fazem again. He saw the way he was holding the phone. The look on his face. Oh dear *fuck.* Had the useless piece of shit actually stopped filming?

“And in our own separate ways,” he went on, faltering slightly, “we have both dedicated our lives to serving it...”

Now his sister had got to her feet, sliding up behind Fazem as though on little wheels. Shosa Hoz looked over Fazem’s shoulder at his phone screen, and her expression switched from fury to something like horror. Then both of them were staring at Hoz, shaking their heads, mouths working silently.

*Don’t,* they were telling him. *Don’t!*

On stage, Hoz licked his lips. Already he could feel he was losing the crowd. Faces were turning to see what had distracted him. People were patting their pockets, before remembering that they didn’t have their own phones with them. Murmurs surrounded him.

If it had been anyone else but Shosa, Hoz would have kept going. Even now he was tempted to ignore her. He was on a roll. This was his moment. But Shosa was not easily shaken, and if she said abort... His heart was pounding. He wondered whether this was what the onset of a cardiac arrest might feel like.

*God damn it,* he thought. *God fucking damn it.*

“And so,” he said, grinning fixedly through the sweat, “I hope you join me all in another round of applause for Qoshoor Sagheedi, and wish him many more years of happy service. Thank you. Thank you all.”

With his skin burning and ears still ringing, he got down from the platform amid polite, confused applause. As the other guests returned to their conversations, doubtless remarking on this anticlimax, he kept his anger buried behind a clench-jawed smile, and stomped to where his so-called team were still standing, open-mouthed, gawping at Fazem’s phone.

“This had better be...”

His voice trailed off, eyes widened.

The device Fazem held in his hand was a mobile phone under siege. Notifications from news apps scrolled down the screen like attackers scaling a castle wall, clambering over each other in their haste to get his attention. RaamNews, the Ez Raam Daily, Radio Ramestan Channel 1, Channel 2; now Twitter, now the BBC, now CNN, RaamNews again. Each had only a second or two before another headline appeared on top of it. Only fragments could be glimpsed.

\noindent Malaf threw her body against a likely-looking door and rammed it open. It led to a stairwell, seldom used. It took a few seconds for the infrared sensors to pick her up and flood the place with yellow-white light. By that time she’d already descended one floor.

Noises, from above and back out through the door: two men arguing. One of them had to be Tarseech. The other? Maybe one of Hoz’s bodyguards. He’d heard a commotion and come running. Now Tarseech was explaining to him that the Sagheedi bitch had attacked him, look what she’d done to his hand, *et cetera*. It was taking time. Buying her precious seconds. She ran.

She felt something move under her dress. It was her dictaphone: one of the lengths of tape holding it in place had come unstuck in the fight. It bounced with every movement. Malaf took four stairs at once in a single bound and the whole thing came free, slipping out from under the fabric and clattering to the hard concrete floor around her ankles.

*Shit,* she thought, and spun around to retrieve it. Its LED was still on. It hadn’t stopped recording, thank God. She just hoped her dress hadn’t muffled it too badly.

And all she’d wanted it to do was record politicians’ small-talk.

She ran so fast she missed the ground floor, had to double back before she followed the stairs all the way into the basement. She reached a door, shoved down on its push bar, and emerged into the hotel’s main lobby.

Guests with suitcases stared at her open-mouthed. She must have looked a mess: barefoot, clothes in a mess, hair exposed and in disarray. Nevertheless, she got the impression that these people were in some sense *pre-astonished*. Her sudden intrusion had merely diverted them from something else that had been occupying their attention – perhaps something that they could see on the hotel’s hanging TV screens, all of which were showing a picture of the Supreme Leader’s face with a BREAKING NEWS banner running across the bottom. Malaf didn’t care. She darted through the lobby, weaving past dumbstruck couples and ducking under the outstretched arm of a doorman who was holding a door half-open.

She escaped from the hotel and into the cool evening. Her bare feet pounded the stone stairs as she descended to street level. How far behind her was Tarseech? If he’d talked his way out of the run-in with Hoz’s bodyguard, he would have no trouble following the trail of shocked faces she had left behind her.

Malaf looked left and right – then straight ahead, into the street.

What she saw stopped her dead. *Oh shit.*

It was a van, decorated with Guard insignia, pulling up to a stop in front of the hotel. The man driving and the man in the passenger seat were both staring at her. Malaf stared right back.

An understanding passed between her and the occupants of the van. In her bare-headed state of disorder, her appearance broke every rule in the public decency book and would have earned her a night in the cells. But, bloody-minded though the Guard undoubtedly were, even *they* could see that this wasn’t a fashion choice. She was in trouble. Their look said: *do you need our help?*

Malaf hesitated. A free ride in the back of a Guard van? It *would* get her out of here. And who knew: maybe she could bring the full force of Ramestan’s famously fair and impartial criminal justice system crashing down on the man who’d killed Lineh Parkiesh. A man well-connected enough to be invited to society dinners with high-ranking politicians and even a Presidential hopeful. Oh yes, that would work out well for her.

*Not a chance,* she thought, and she ran.

She sprinted around the side of the Grand Astihari Hotel, running as fast as she could over the uneven pavement. Were they even following her? She didn’t dare look over her shoulder.

In one hand she still held the dictaphone.

*You’re forgetting your tradecraft,* a voice in her head lectured her; it sounded like Qaseh, that superior tone. *You think you might fall into enemy hands? Then why the hell do you still have the evidence on you?*

She was at the back of the building now, in a dark alley where unidentifiable inlet pipes and switching boxes hummed and vibrated. Something stashed here could stay hidden for years. Quickly she bent down and slid the dictaphone into the shadowy gap underneath one of these structures.

She didn’t see anyone behind her. Maybe they had lost her, or given up. No way to tell. She kept running.

*You want to evade your pursuers? Then think like them. Ask yourself: how would* you *catch you. What would* you *be doing right now?*

Her inner Qaseh was no doubt referring to the Guards, but right now Malaf’s main concern was Tarseech. What was *he* doing?

Right now he was accepting that he’d lost her. Running out into the street wouldn’t help him: she was already gone. He was thinking about where she would run. That meant her apartment was no longer safe: he knew her name, and her home phone number was on her business card. Finding where she lived would be easy with his connections.

What about her father? Could he protect her? From Tarseech, certainly. But who did Tarseech know? Who in that room had the ear of a senior Guard member? Being Qoshoor Sagheedi’s daughter was no guarantee of protection. The Guard often went after members of a politician’s family. It was on page one of the Ramestani politics handbook.

Then she would need to disappear, for a few days at least, until she could formulate a plan. Not just into a hotel under a fake name – Tarseech would find her in no time. A friend’s house? Potentially even less safe.

She thought hard. Where could she go that *nobody* would find her?

And she realised she had an answer.

It was, by any metric she could devise, a terrible answer. Maybe, if she had had more time, she could have found a better one. But tonight, on the run, she could think of nothing else that could beat it.

Malaf ran out onto the street and lost herself in the pedestrian traffic. She pulled the hood of her dress over her hair, and tried to walk as if being barefoot on Ez Raami pavements was perfectly normal. She would need new clothes, and to pack a bag. It would be a risk going home even for that long, but she didn’t have much choice. And then...

She remembered that she didn’t have her phone. That was annoying: she’d wouldn’t be able to call ahead. But it wouldn’t matter. The chances are, Qaseh would already be expecting her.

Because it turned out he’d been right all along. Malaf Sagheedi would be going with him, back to Ez Nezeshti. It was her only choice.

She told herself it wouldn’t be too bad. It would just be for a few days.

What was the worst that could happen?


\vspace*{50px}

## II

By the time Malaf crawled through the broken window and plopped down onto the street, the sound of the Sixty’s engine had faded into the wind. She considered firing the gun into the air. Perhaps it would be loud enough for them to hear. She doubted it. And, anyway, she couldn’t risk broadcasting her location – or wasting a bullet.

She looked down at the gun in her hand. How the hell did you fire one of these things, anyway? When Qaseh had explained about the safety she hadn’t really been paying attention. She noticed a little switch she could press on the gun’s side, and the manufacturers had helpfully etched the word ‘ON’ into the metal. But did that mean ON as in the safety was on, or ON as in the gun was ready to fire? This kind of bad design irked her even in non life-threatening circumstances. She would give the gun poor reviews online if she survived today.

Malaf took a deep breath, then sprinted diagonally across the street, feeling her exposure to the windows behind her as an almost physical burning on her back. She could be shot at any second. Any second now. Any second...

She made it to the other side and around the corner of a ruined shop. She was safe, for now. She let out the breath she’d been holding, then began looking around, trying to work out the way to the campsite. To Qaseh’s car.

A sound, terrifyingly loud, startled her. An electronic squeal. She spun around trying to locate it. It seemed to be coming from everywhere at once.

No: it was coming from *her.*

Clipped to her belt, completely forgotten, was her two-way radio handset.

Her eyes widened. *Irooj!* She snatched the radio up so hard she nearly broke the clip holding it in place. Her fingers fumbled on the ‘transmit’ button. She spoke breathlessly.

“Irooj!” she barked. “Thank God. Listen, I’m still here. Turn back. We killed one of them but there’s still another left.”

She listened, waited.

Tried again.

“Hello? Can you hear me?”

Her voice trailed off as she realised she was speaking into silence. “Irooj?” she asked, now uncertain.

“Good afternoon, Ms Sagheedi.”

A man’s voice.

Malaf closed her eyes. Breathed.

“We haven’t been formally introduced,” the man went on. “My name’s Ressi. I believe you’ve already met my brother.”

*Don’t say a word,* Malaf told herself. *He knows you’re close but he can’t find you. He wants you to stay still and talk while he closes in on you.*

She started walking, fast.

“Anybody there?” Over the airwaves Ressi’s voice was perfectly affable. “Hello?”

*He wants you to talk. Give away your position. Say nothing.*

“Hello?”

*Say nothing!*

But Malaf brought the radio to her lips anyway. “I didn’t realise you were family,” she said.

“People often don’t,” Ressi replied. His voice was eerily flat. “Sorry: *didn’t*, I should say. The past tense. That’ll take some getting used to. I will miss him, useless bastard though he was.”

Malaf wondered what tone of voice a sane man would adopt to say this. Certainly not this one. And Ressi’s next words were positively cheerful. “Oh well! It’s done now. We move on, right? Why focus on the past, when your immediate future is likely to be so eventful?”

“How did you get the radio?” Malaf asked, although she had already guessed the answer.

“I took it from your friends’ car after they smashed it. Did you see that? After a knock like that I’m amazed its engine even started. People laugh about the Pasham Sixty, say it’s ugly. But real beauty is what’s *inside*, don’t you think?”

Malaf knew she should be running. She knew her life depended on dropping the radio and putting as much distance between her and him as she could. But she couldn’t; not with so much still to know.

“Who sent you?” she asked. “Was it Asram Tarseech?”

Ressi laughed drily. “What a life you must lead, Ms Sagheedi, to have to ask which *particular* person wants you dead today?”

*Funny man*, Malaf thought. She kept walking, down streets that were familiar to her now. She was nearly there.

“No, Tarseech isn’t a name I know,” Ressi went on cheerily. “But: I did have a very illuminating phone conversation, quite recently, with a man whose name you might have heard. A certain *political* figure, in fact.”

This stopped her mid-stride.

“*Who?*” she asked hoarsely.

“Well, that’s the big secret, isn’t it?” Ressi drawled. “I mean, I always guessed it had to be *someone* in the government sending so much work our way. But why wasn’t he able to – ah – *remove* his enemies using more official means? It could only be because he was an outsider. Not truly part of the establishment. No friends in the Guard to do his dirty work for him.”

Malaf thought back to the party at the Grand Astihari. Her father hadn’t wanted to invite Tarseech, but did it anyway, because the man was a friend of...

“Ebri Hoz.”

“Oh, so you know him?” Ressi asked, sounding a little upset that she’d guessed. “A very distinctive voice, has Mr Hoz, and it’s all over the radio these days. No wonder he wouldn’t speak with us directly. Used an old woman as a go-between. That was good enough for his regular jobs, but oh my goodness, when he found out you were going to *Ez Nezeshti...* You wouldn’t believe how crazy that made him. So now you tell me, Ms Sagheedi: what is *he* afraid of? What’s out here?”

And Malaf, thinking of oil rigs, said, quietly: “Nothing. That’s the problem.”

“Huh.” Ressi appeared to ponder this for a moment, then put the thought aside. “How very interesting. We should talk about it in person. What do you say? Call a truce, meet as friends?”

“Not a chance.”

“Rats. You have entirely failed to be taken in by my superficial charm. It looks like I’ll just have to hunt you down and kill you.”

Malaf eased her thumb off the ‘send’ button so she could break into a jog without Ressi hearing her. She only half-listened to his voice as she went.

“Since finding my brother in his present condition, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I might do that,” he was saying. “Kill you, I mean. Once I’ve got you cornered. I wondered whether I might start by cutting your fingers off one by one. Or maybe shooting you in the knees and watching you crawl around till you bleed to death. How does that sound, Ms Sagheedi? *Your feedback is important to us.*”

Malaf didn’t switch the radio off, but she turned the volume down to zero. Let him talk into the empty airwaves: maybe she’d hear his voice nearby and know which way to run.

She turned a corner, and a moment later the campsite was right in front of her. Qaseh’s car sat on the car park, white and shining like a beacon in the night. She ran towards it, screwing her eyes tightly shut as she passed Boraz’s body. When she reached the car – when both her open palms touched its sun-hot metal sides – the cry of relief that escaped her was so loud she thought it would bring Ressi right on top of her.

She touched the keys in her trouser pocket. Still there. It had been years since she’d driven a car. They said it was something one never forgot how to do. This would be an interesting way of finding out.

*Okay,* she thought. *Let’s do this.*

She got in the driver’s seat. Qaseh had it so far back that her feet hardly touched the pedals. She fumbled for the lever to move it, feeling ridiculous at having to waste these seconds. She thought: *If Ressi finds me while I’m doing this I’ll die of embarrassment before the bullets hit me.*

The car’s engine started on the first go, its noise splitting the dead air like a jet taking off. Ressi must have heard it; she had to assume he had. *Get out now.*

She wanted to floor it, tyres screeching as she zoomed off into the distance. But turning in the car park seemed to eat up an age. Second after second after second squandered. Out of the football field’s car park, then a left turn to head back the way they had come. Even when she got onto the street she couldn’t go quickly. Nosing the unfamiliar car between craters and around loose rubble was like driving through treacle.

She reached a junction and turned left, towards the main road out of town. She glanced in the rear view mirror – and saw a figure, running her way.

Ressi. *Shit.*

She stamped down on the accelerator, felt the car surge forward. It bounced over the uneven ground. Malaf dropped her head down as far as it would go and waited for the sound of gunfire. Seconds passed, buildings streaked by – no shots came.

Malaf risked a look in the mirror. No sign of Ressi: she must have left him far behind.

But it wouldn’t be for long. Malaf knew it, and Ressi knew it too.

---

\noindent Malaf made it onto the main road leading east out of Ez Nezeshti. Even here it wasn’t plain sailing: the retreating army had left in place endless roadblocks and obstructions to slow her down. She wove the car around piled sandbags, abandoned machine gun emplacements.

The squeal of the radio handset made her jump again. Ressi trying to talk to her again. She ignored it.

Finally she got through what seemed to be the last of it. The damage in the road still shuddered through the wheels beneath her, but she felt she could go faster without losing control. Gritting her teeth, she accelerated. Her eyes kept flicking from the view of road ahead to the speedometer. *Faster. Faster.*

Time passed: entire minutes of nothing but engine noise and the flick of tiny upthrown flecks against the car’s windscreen and underbelly. Malaf checked the rear-view mirror. She knew her tyres would be sending up enough dust to be seen for a long way around. God might as well have drawn an arrow pointing right at her.

The radio, again. Malaf looked at it, sitting there in the passenger seat, beside the gun. *Ah, hell,* she thought, and held the handset to her ear.

“Now where exactly do you think you’re going?” Ressi asked her. Malaf could hear noises in the background that could only mean that he too was driving.

“Ez Nasha,” Malaf told him. “Going for a boat trip.”

“Funny, I was just saying the same thing to Payim. How about we go together?”

“Thanks, but when I travel I need my own space.”

“That must be why you left in such a hurry. I can see you, Ms Sagheedi. Can you see me?”

Another glance in the rear view mirror. Yes, she could see him: a blinding pinprick of reflected sunlight on the road behind her. A long way away. But getting closer.

“Do you really think you can get away from me in that thing?”

“Let’s find out.”

“We will, in a moment,” Ressi assured her. “But even if you do shake me off – you won’t, but even if you *did* – you do know you’re dead meat anyway, don’t you?”

Malaf stared dead ahead, unblinking.

“Even if you got all the way home, do you think this will just go away? The people who hired us, you think they’ll just let you *live?*”

Malaf had heard enough. She wound down the driver’s side window and tossed the radio handset out of the car. The hot desert air streamed into her face, making her eyes water. She wound the window back up again. Then, after a moment’s reflection, she fastened her seatbelt.

The accelerator pedal was down as far as it would go, but Ressi’s van was still gaining on her. As she watched its approach, some detached, analytical part of her brain couldn’t help framing it in terms of relative velocities. Let *x* be the top speed Malaf could reach on this road. Let Ressi’s speed equal *x* plus some number. On a road that was as long and straight as something out of a textbook, the distance between the two vehicles was shrinking to zero. Run the numbers. How long did she have?

Not long enough.

One last look at the mirror as the van grew larger. The road was uneven, the mirror bounced; but suddenly she could see, or only imagined she could see because she knew it would be there, the arm coming out of the driver’s side window, pointing at her, levelling the gun.

Malaf slid as far down and forward in her seat as she could. *Here we go.*

The first bullet hitting her car was something she felt rather than heard. It shook the metal all around her. She had no idea where she’d been hit. She’d been expecting the impact but still she flinched on the steering wheel. The car swayed on the road. Malaf took the wobble and ran with it, turned it into a swerve. It cost her time, ate into the distance that remained, but it made her that much harder to hit.

The next shot she did hear. The driver’s side wing mirror exploded into fragments.

Left to right and left again across the tarmac. One shot missed her entirely. Another punched a hole through the windscreen on the passenger’s side.

Another shot, this one coming with an explosive sound from behind and beneath her. That was a tyre going. Malaf tried to keep control of the car but its wobbling soon became unmanageable.

She reached out and grabbed the gun off the passenger’s seat. Her plan – if one could call the stream of disjointed intuitions arriving near-simultaneously in her head a plan – was to slam on the brakes and let Ressi overshoot her, then fire her last remaining bullets at him on his way past. Maybe she would get lucky.

She did brake, but the car minus a tyre behaved in ways she didn’t understand. She veered rapidly to one side. Then, suddenly, she was spinning.

What happened next happened so quickly that she didn’t have time to react; she merely observed. She was fleetingly aware that car had left the road. There was a space, lasting maybe no more than a second or two, in which she was driving over rough ground. The line of the horizon though the broken windscreen jumped around crazily, then *rolled over*.

For a few long seconds: total disorientation. Total blur. She was at the centre of a hurricane. Movement was all.

Then it was over.

---

\noindent Malaf blinked, looked around.

The world had ceased to make sense. Gravity wasn’t working the way it was supposed to. Her body strained against the seat belt in places that weren’t normal.

It took her a moment to understand that the car was upside down.

Its engine was silent, probably stalled. There was an alarm, a regular electronic *ping* about once a second; the car’s way of informing the driver that something might be amiss. *Thank you, car*, Malaf wanted to say.

She rolled her head around. Looking up – down – she saw the gun lying on the cracked glass of the sunroof. She reached for it, feeling the awkward way her arm dangled. The tips of her fingers brushed against it but couldn’t get a grip.

Between the pings of the alarm, in those interstices of silence, tyres crunched over loose ground somewhere nearby.

Malaf braced herself with one arm, and with the other unfastened her seat belt. She let herself unfold, tried to guide the descent. She sprawled against the warm fuzz of the roof, feet still tangled between the pedals. There was blood in her mouth. She could smell petrol.

No more noise from the van. Ressi had stopped some distance away. A door opened, slammed shut.

“Impressive!” he called out cheerily. “That was quite a manoeuvre you pulled there, Ms Sagheedi. Looked rough. I don’t suppose you were killed in the crash, were you?”

Malaf froze with her hand halfway to the gun. Stayed perfectly still. *Ping. Ping.*

“Oh you were? Phew. Lucky break for me, huh? Then I guess I’ll be heading back home now. So long!”

He wasn’t leaving. Footsteps, getting closer.

*Ping. Ping. Ping.*

Malaf quit the pretence and grabbed the gun. She managed to twist her body around and get a look through the shattered glass of the passenger’s side window. She saw a pair of feet. Small targets, moving, far away; and her with no knowledge of firearms, lying upside down, barely able to move.

She took aim as best as she could and fired. The noise was astonishingly loud.

When she opened her eyes again she saw that Ressi had retreated a few steps, but was still standing. She was aware of him saying something, but couldn’t make out the words.

She pulled the trigger again and again. The sound this time was felt as a physical force on her eardrums rather than heard; but there had only been one bang. The second time, the hammer had fallen on nothing.

She’d missed, too. Ressi had taken a few more steps back, but was advancing again cautiously, taking a sideways route, circling the car. She watched his legs approach. Doubtless his gun arm was extended, covering the flipped car, ready for her to try to run. As if there was anywhere left to go.

“This has already taken way too long,” she heard him say. She could just about make the words out. His tone had a certain finality to it. She imagined him aiming the gun, taking one more step closer.

She shut her eyes.

The sound, when it came, was louder than anything she had ever heard before. With it came sudden darkness, like a cloud blocking the sun, and a spray of loose earth against her face. The ground shook. Her ears rang.

And continued to ring.

---

\noindent Some time later, Malaf found, to her surprise, that she still had eyes to open. Too weak to move, she lay there, motionless in the ruined car that had protected her. She waited. Waited for something to happen, anything at all.

That time of concussed, oceanic stillness could only have lasted for a few minutes, but it felt to Malaf like years passing in introspective silence. The wreck of the car was the site of her hermitage. Deafened by the blast, she was alone with her thoughts, her memories.

She remembered Lineh. Small details from their brief time together. The way they had held hands once, outdoors, when there had been nobody who could see them; the way their fingers hadn’t quite meshed. The way she sipped her tea, always leaving a tiny drop on the rim of the cup, and she’d bring the cup to her lip to catch it, like a tiny kiss.

And then another memory, this one much older. Qaseh’s voice. It was a casual comment he’d made so many years ago, unthought of for all this time. It was strange that Malaf should remember it at all.

It was something he’d said on their first ever drive to Ez Nezeshti. They had been talking about the poison gas that had been dropped on this town in the war. He’d assured them it was nothing to be scared of. That it would all have blown away by now, or degraded until it was no longer toxic. Nothing to fear.

*If you do insist on worrying,* he’d said, *I’d worry about unexploded land mines.*

---

\noindent It was thirst that drove her out in the end. A bottle of water had rolled out of one of the upturned car’s broken windows and come to rest further away than she could reach. She tiptoed over to it and didn’t die.

After that, Malaf began to walk towards Ressi’s van.

She made sure that her path took her through the crater Ressi had left – this being, she theorised, the one place she knew for certain to be free of mines. What remained of Ressi was lying some distance away, shapeless, dusty grey on slick red. She tried not to look at it as she traced his footprints backwards, examining each spot of dirt before gingerly putting any weight on it.

She made it to the van. Its key was still in the ignition.

Then came the reversing: the slow, desperate inching backwards. There was no rear window to look through, only mirrors. She’d never been great at telling left from right; here, a mistake could get her killed. It was the driving test from hell.

One last push of the engine lurched her over the side of the road and onto smooth tarmac.

Malaf closed her eyes, let out a long exhale. The hiss of warm breath leaving her lips was something she could make out, just barely, above the ringing. After the close-quarters gunfire and the explosion, everything sounded like she had her head underwater. Maybe by the time she got back to Ez Raam she’d be able to hear properly again.

It would take time. Lucky for her, the road ahead was very, very long.

## III

The dictaphone was hot in Malaf’s hand. She knew it shouldn’t be. She knew that metal conducts body heat and radiates it away, and that even at room temperature metal should feel cold. But now its sharp-edged case of brushed aluminium seemed almost too hot to hold. It was as if it might explode at any moment.

Her *evidence*.

She had done all she could on her own. Malaf had learned the name of Lineh’s killer. She had been to the desert and seen an empty space where an oil rig should have been. She had fought off men sent to kill her. She had done all of these things, and it had not been enough. The forces hunting her would never give up – not while she was just one woman operating alone.

So she had come up with a plan. A few days ago it would have seemed desperately naive. Now it was merely desperate. But if there was one person in Ez Raam who cared about evidence, corruption, proof – who cared about *her* – she knew where to find him.

She had played the recording back, over and over, in the back of the taxi. With her body stretched out along the seat and her head down in case by some fluke one of the Guard spotted her, she had turned its volume down almost into silence, and pressed its speaker against her ear.

*She wrote about you. The way you were obsessed with her.*

The taxi driver had his radio on. Like everyone else in Ez Raam he was glued to the news, waiting for word of the Supreme Leader but hearing nothing but prayers said in his name. It was hard for Malaf to make out the words coming out of the dictaphone, muffled as they were by the fabric of her dress.

*She wrote about it right until the night she vanished. The night...*

“Almost there, ma’am,” the driver said.

“Thank you,” Malaf said. “Let me off here.”

*The night you killed her.*

---

\noindent The building ahead of her was the colour and texture of law: unadorned grey concrete, stern and cracked. The taxi dropped her off just as office hours supposedly ended, but these were extraordinary times and Malaf saw no sign of anyone leaving.

She tried to picture what it would be like inside a government office on the night the Supreme Leader lay dying. Would there be frantic activity? But doing what? Surely it was too early to start burning old documents, burying the sins of one administration that might not survive the scrutiny of the next. The old man might yet pull through. It was probably best to do nothing. She imagined them watching the news, heads bowed in silent prayer, but with hands full of printouts, and tiny footsteps inching them ever so slowly towards the shredder in the corner...

Malaf walked through the building’s open front door. The man in the wheelchair behind the reception desk was Mr Soohar; the war had left him a double amputee and blinded him in one eye, and as far as Malaf knew, he had been working here ever since.

Right now his attention was as fixed to the room’s TV as the taxi driver’s had been to his radio. It would have been convenient if she could have slipped past him without being noticed, but she needed him to buzz her through the door.

“Mr Soohar?” she said gently.

Mr Soohar turned to her. “Terrible time, this,” he said, and Malaf found it hard to disagree.

“I’d like to see my father, please.”

Mr Soohar nodded absently and pressed a button on his desk. The door beside him clicked and Malaf stepped through.

By the time he realised the mistake he’d made, it was too late to call her back.

---

\noindent Malaf exited the lift and turned right, following a path that was familiar enough to know by heart but too close to the maw of state power for her to feel entirely comfortable. Everything was creepy. The threadbare carpet underfoot. The religious and political slogans pinned to every wall. A display of faded photos: former employees martyred in the war. A Ramestani flag hung at the end of the corridor beside a vase of flowers, and both flag and flowers were wilting.

A door was open on her left. She knew that this led to the open plan office where her father’s small staff did whatever it was they did all day. She had walked past them enough times to know most of them by sight. She had names for some of them. The man with the silly moustache. The woman who said *ah* every few moments.

As she entered the office, she had certain expectations of how people would react. Polite nods, a silent wave. As a member of the public she wasn’t supposed to be in here, but everyone knew she was the boss’s daughter, and would let it slide.

The moment she walked in, all eyes turned on her, and she knew something was wrong.

“Where is he?” she asked the room, her voice shaking.

Even as she spoke the words, she knew the answer; knew it with a sinking dread. She saw them through the frosted-glass windows of her father’s private office: men in green uniforms. They were searching through boxes of documents, packing up his computer. Long, diffuse zones of black against the green of their bodies could only have been the machine guns they were carrying.

Nobody had said anything yet. Malaf backed away, knowing already that it was too late.

A Guard had heard a noise, or the sudden absence of noise, and poked his head through the door. He saw Malaf and the recognition was instant. *Her.*

Malaf spun around and bolted for the exit. *Not now,* she thought. *Please. Not after coming so close...*

She managed only a few steps down the corridor before two more men with guns cut her off. They goggled at her, double-taking in almost comically perfect unison. It was as if they couldn’t believe their luck.

Malaf knew she was trapped, but she reckoned she had a few tenths of a second to make the best of their confusion. With one quick leap forward she tried to shove her way out between the two Guards, guessing that they wouldn’t dare fire their guns in a crowded office. But they saw it coming. They pulled closer together and she bounced off their bodies like a tennis ball thrown against a wall. She staggered backwards, tripped, and fell, sprawling backwards onto the floor.

From there on everything happened with the polished efficiency one would expect from true professionals. One man pinned her down with a knee across her back, driving her face into the ground. She fought it but the weight was too much for her. Strong arms pulled her wrists together behind her back and slipped a plastic strap around them, yanked it tight. That was when she realised, far too late, that her hands were empty. The dictaphone had fallen from her grasp.

*Don’t react,* Malaf told herself. *Don’t draw attention to it. Let them take you away. Fine. You still have a chance as long as they don’t have it...*

“Hey,” one Guard said to another, “shall I take this?”

“What is it?” was the reply. “Some kind of tape recorder? Sure, bring it along.”

*Fuck!*

A new panic and rage drove her to shriek and kick again. The ferocity startled the man pinning her down – but wasn’t enough to dislodge him. They pulled her to her feet and marched her down the corridor. She didn’t struggle any more. There didn’t seem to be much point.

In the lift down to the ground floor they kept a hand on her head to keep her gaze pointed straight down. She tried to keep track of the bodies around her. Who was who? Which one had the dictaphone? Without hearing a voice there would be no way of knowing.

The doors opened. With a hard shove they pushed her back out through the reception. As she passed the front desk she heard Mr Soohar start to say something.

“Malaf, I’m sorry, I didn’t—”

But either a Guard shut him up or else he passed out of earshot too quickly, because she didn’t make out the rest.

Then she was out on the street. A Guard van was parked some distance away. She thought about that distance, estimated the number of paces: maybe forty. That was forty chances to break free and run for her life. But seconds later it was thirty, then twenty, then ten, and they were still on her, blocking any chance of escape.

*Last chance,* she thought, and braced herself for one more fight.

“Wait!”

It was a man’s voice, a voice she was sure she recognised. It brought the Guards to a sudden stop.

Malaf could see into the van’s interior, the padded cage they used to transport their victims. It was dark inside and stank of urine. The Guards were holding her right in front of its open door, but they weren’t yet pushing her inside.

Hope, thin and desperate, flickered inside her.

“Let me see her.”

Rough hands spun her around, allowing her to look into the eyes of the man who had saved her at the last instant.

When she saw that it was the Captain, her heart sank.

The man stared at her, nostrils flaring. Malaf could see the beginnings of a nasty bruise forming under his cap. She wondered if it hurt. Quite a lot, probably. The Captain twisted his mouth into something resembling a smile.

Then he punched her, hard, across the face.

“Yeah, that’s her,” he told the others, turning away.

For a few seconds neither of the men holding her moved a muscle. They seemed genuinely shocked, or perhaps they simply hadn’t heard anything over Malaf’s screams. Then they came to their senses, lifted Malaf off her feet, and threw her bodily into the back of the van.

The door slammed on her, trapping her in blackness. Too racked with pain and emotionally numb to move, Malaf simply lay there, her bruised and bleeding cheek throbbing dully against the floor. After a few minutes the van’s engine started, and she felt them lurch off the kerb and into the first pothole of the long, slow journey to the prison.

It occurred to Malaf, as she lay there, trussed up and helpless, that her hands were probably cuffed with the same plastic cable ties that Qaseh had once broken out of. She thought about that day in his flat, recalling it with a surprising fondness. The memory of him wriggling on the floor like a lunatic brought a wry smile to her lips. It seemed in poor taste to laugh at the man, considering the fact that he was most likely dead; but in times like this, cheery thoughts were hard to come by. One took what one could get.

# TWELVE

\vspace*{50px}


The woman in the long green coat walked with a stiff, upright gait meant to signal to the hawkers that they would be wasting their time with her. Nevertheless, they tried; they always did.

“Sorafenib? Miss?”

“Hey! Miss! Ipilimumab? Emtricitabine? Miss?”

“Hello? Miss?”

She ignored them, just like she was ignoring the vibration of the phone in her trouser pocket. She knew it could only be Malaf. The woman was laughably predictable in her habits. She probably hadn’t realised she’d fallen into such a straightforward routine. Either that, or she’d done it deliberately, and had by some calculus picked this as the optimal time to try to call. Perhaps it was unfair to caricature poor Malaf in this way, but it was so easy to imagine her keeping a record of these calls: the times she made them, how many times she’d let it ring before hanging up. Malaf was organised like that. She would have opened up a fresh notebook. There would be different coloured pens.

Well, whether by accident or design, it was eight thirty in the evening, and once again Malaf was calling to ask for Lineh to take her back.

At least, that’s what Lineh assumed. It was entirely possible that all Malaf wanted was scream insults at her. Or break down in tears. It was hard to say.

*God*, she thought. *If only the stupid cow would just get over it.*

Lineh wondered if such thoughts made her cruel. She was aware that she had a mean streak, or at least a selfish one. But didn’t life in Ramestan do that to everyone? You kept to yourself, and you looked after yourself. That was how you survived.

And anyway: tonight she had even more reason than usual to ignore her phone.

Lineh used her key card to open the doors of the building. The lobby lights were dimmed, the building weirdly quiet. She had a story prepared in case she got stopped by security guards, but if any were on patrol, she didn’t see them. There was a football match on – Ramestan *v* Iran – and they were likely hiding in their break room watching the action.

As she rode the lift to the fifth floor, she reflected again on the strange coincidence that had put her on her current trajectory.

Yes, Malaf was in the past now. But it couldn’t be denied: it was *Malaf* who had brought her here, tonight, with her laptop.

Malaf, and Ez Nezeshti.

---

\noindent Lineh remembered coughing dust.

“God,” she exclaimed, “when was the last time anyone cleaned down here?”

Maara considered this. “Well, since it used to be a bomb shelter... no longer ago than the war.”

Maara turned on the lights. Cardboard boxes were stacked up so high that the bottom layers were buckling. Old documents inside were doubtless undergoing whatever geological process it was that turned organic matter under compression into oil. In a million years some prospector would drill into this sub-sub-sub-basement, passing through compacted strata of fossilised spreadsheets, and make a fortune.

“Now, they definitely won’t be in one of those,” Maara told her, indicating a stack of documents that would have required a forklift truck to shift. “I’d start over *here*, and then maybe look *here* if you can’t find them.”

“It’s going to take all day.”

Maara shrugged helplessly. “I’d help you if I could, but with the dust, and my allergies...”

“It’s fine, Maara.”

“Thanks, Lineh.” Maara smiled at her. Then she said, offhandedly: “Are you coming tonight? I’m sure Malaf would like to see you.”

Lineh stared at her, instantly alert. “*Excuse* me?” she asked.

“The French session,” Maara reminded her. “In Café Kesh. We haven’t seen you in ages. Malaf too, come to think of it.”

“Oh, yes. I’d forgotten.” The smile Lineh gave Maara was as rigid as a Noh mask. “No, I think I’ll pass this time. Thanks for the invite, though. Shall I crack on?”

When Maara had gone back upstairs Lineh let out a long exhale. *French sessions,* she thought with a small smile. *Au revior, ma cherie...*

Then she put her headphones on, picked a song on her mobile, and began to work.

After an hour she had searched four boxes and found only one of the documents she’d been told to find. The long sleeves of her shirt were filthy with dust. She added it to growing list of reasons to quit as soon as she could find another job – as if her creep of a boss wasn’t enough of one already.

She was putting things back into box number four when her eyes drifted over a sheet of printed paper and picked out a name. She thought nothing of it for a few moments, and her body continued to move on autopilot until realisation dawned and she hesitated. She re-read the page’s title: Ez Nezeshti Region Hydrocarbon Extraction Project.

*Ez Nezeshti?* No, *surely* not...

She pulled the bundle of papers out and had a closer look. Yes, there it was on the map. And there again, listed in the attached spreadsheet printouts. She looked over it all with a delighted smile on her face. It was almost a shame they weren’t talking; Malaf would have loved this.

She looked more closely, wondering what the documents were. Details leapt out at her. They were things only an insider would have noticed. An unusual sort code. A column of figures, some of them in USD. A lot of pages marked ‘Confidential – Destroy’.

After a while she turned off the music.

Without taking her eyes off the sheet in front of her she hopped onto one of the cardboard boxes and sat there cross-legged. She read page after page. After a while she began taking notes.

It was another hour before she returned to the office. She did it quietly, not meeting anyone’s gaze.

“She survived!” Maara joked. “That took ages, you poor thing – Lineh, are you all right?”

“Hmm?”

“You look really pale. It must have been the dust. Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Lineh said. “Like you said: the dust.”

“Get yourself some fresh air,” Maara advised her. “You’ve earned it. Did you find them?”

“Just this one,” Lineh said, handing over a single sheet of paper.

“Oh dear. Well, we looked. If Asram doesn’t like it, he can go down there himself. Thanks, Lineh.” She smiled, then hesitated, glancing at the documents Lineh was carrying under one arm. “Are those...?”

“Unrelated,” Lineh said with a quick smile. “Some old junk. I’ll just go dump it on my desk.”

She said *dump*, but she handled the papers carefully, as if they might explode at any minute.

---

\noindent Lineh knew how to chase paper. It was, after all, all she did all day.

She was desperate to confirm what she had uncovered, but knew there were very few people she could safely talk to. Not anybody in her own company, and *definitely* not anybody in PetRaam. She needed to talk to someone on the periphery.

So she called the geologist, Ros Khesri. He was as baffled as she had been: yes, he had advised PetRaam about Ez Nezeshti and the other sites, but that had been years ago and, as far as he knew, the whole project had been deemed non-viable and abandoned. If they had re-opened the investigation into drilling, why hadn’t he been consulted?

“It *is* odd,” Lineh said into the phone, frowning. “But are you sure that was the end of your involvement? Because I see your signature on this page here, and the date is...”

She trailed off, wishing she hadn’t spoken. In front of her was the original report, signed by Khesri. Beside it was a more recent letter, in Khesri’s name and signed by Khesri. But the signatures didn’t match. They weren’t even close.

“No, that must be a mistake,” Khesri insisted. “Perhaps you could email me a copy?”

Lineh hesitated. “Sure, I’ll do that today,” she assured him. But she had no intention of doing it. She thought about the trail she was leaving. She wished she hadn’t used a work phone to call him. She got off the line as soon as she could, cutting him off halfway through saying goodbye.

At her home that evening, she opened her phone’s calculator app and started to total the figures. Ten million here, twelve million there... She gave a low whistle when she read the final number. Wow. *Wow.*

That night she didn’t get much sleep; couldn’t even shut her eyes. All that money... There was no way she would be able to work out whose pockets it had disappeared into.

But maybe... maybe there were people who could.

And she thought back to that night with Malaf, when she’d talked about her short career as a smuggler. What was the name she’d had for her old friends? Q? Big Q? Something like that.

\noindent She got off on the fifth floor. The lights here weren’t dimmed: they were off completely. Lineh hadn’t thought of that. She was taking her mobile phone out of her pocket, thinking of using its screen as a torch, when something clicked softly and the space around her exploded into brilliance. For a long, horrified moment she thought she’d been discovered. Then she saw the red blink of an infrared sensor in the corner of the room, and realised it was automatic.

It took a few minutes for her breathing and heart rate to return to normal. It wasn’t fear exactly that she felt, but exhilaration. It was the same feeling she had had when delivering the original set of documents to Big Q’s dead drop in Martyrs Garden. It was the thrill of walking out of your cage as if its bars were made of smoke; the dizzy feeling of *agency.* But like any addiction, its effects wore off. Soon she needed a bigger dose.

The material was great, Big Q told her by secure message. He (She? They?) was making it the centre of a big investigation. It would be the story of the year, guaranteed, even if that was all there was. But... *was* that all there was?

Lineh’s backpack felt enormously heavy, even though it contained almost nothing except her laptop. Hopefully she wouldn’t even need it: just a USB stick would be enough.

*Whatever you do,* Big Q had insisted, *please don’t do anything to put yourself in danger.*

She went to her desk and sat down, turning on her desktop computer. She drummed her fingers impatiently as it went through its bootup cycle. Tired of waiting, she got up to get a glass of water. The staff canteen was through a door on the other side of the office, and she walked over.

As she walked, she realised that she wasn’t alone. There was noise, movement, coming from the room next door.

That was okay, she thought, fighting down panic. It wasn’t unusual for people to come in after hours if deadlines were tight. She could say she had forgotten something she needed for the weekend, and had come in to pick it up. She could talk her way out of anything – but not if she ran away as if she had something to hide. If she wanted to pretend this was an evening like any other, she would have to say hi to this person.

Hoping it would be Maara, or someone else who wouldn’t ask too many questions, she poked her head around the door. “Hello?”

She was looking into the larger of the company’s meeting rooms, where bimonthly all-team meetings were held. It was slightly too small for this purpose: lower-ranking employees inevitably ended up sitting on the floor or propping themselves up against the display cases in the back. Right now it held only one person: a man, in a far corner, huddled as if he were in a crowded train carriage and didn’t want to disturb his neighbours. He was bent over some paperwork. A company laptop was open beside him, its screen in standby mode as if he’d been sitting there, motionless, for some time.

When she saw who it was, she didn’t panic, although she felt as though she should.

“Lineh,” said Asram Tarseech, looking up at her with surprise. “You...”

“Mr Tarseech,” she said, coldly.

He smiled at her. “I was just going over the Ez Espaisi report one more time before we send it off. But now I think I won’t bother. It’s so good to see you. Come over here.”

“I was just leaving.”

“Don’t be shy. Come over.”

Lineh sighed. She had spent so long preparing for this evening, coming up with a cover story, working up the courage. Now, not only had the whole plan disintegrated; she also had to deal with this creep. She was alone with him, which made her nervous. But then again, perhaps this would be an opportunity to tell him to back off, put him off for good – or, if not for good, at least until she could find another job. Reluctantly, with tiredness and resignation dripping from her every movement, she slouched over to where he was sitting.

“Lineh,” Tarseech said, his voice soft and sad. “Lineh, Lineh, Lineh...”

“Yes, Mr Tarseech?”

“You never call me Asram.”

“What do you want with me?”

“What I want. What I want.”

Tarseech faltered. Lineh watched him, watched the way his eyes moved. She noticed a glass beside his laptop half-full of amber liquid. His voice didn’t sound right to her.

She couldn’t believe it. Was Tarseech... *drunk?*

“I’ve always tried to be good to you, Lineh,” he said. “Even though you don’t like me.”

An invitation, of course, for Lineh to say she *did* like him, really. “I don’t like you coming to my home outside work,” she told him flatly. “Please stop.”

“I remember seeing you the first time,” he went on, as if he hadn’t heard her. “That first day when you came in for work. Everything about you was so... pure.”

Lineh couldn’t help letting out a snort at this. Tarseech’s gaze snapped up to meet hers. There was anger in it.

“Mr Tarseech,” she said, keeping her voice calm and even, “it’s not appropriate for you to act this way. I’m trying to keep things professional.”

“I just want you to be happy...”

“My happiness is no business of yours.”

“I just want you to be *happy,*” he repeated. “Sometimes life is hard, and no boss in the world can fix that. Only a... only a friend can. I want to be there for you. If sending you flowers makes you smile—”

“I threw them away.”

Tarseech swallowed. He looked to be on the verge of tears.

“I should go,” Lineh said finally.

“Stay,” he said, reaching out to take her arm. His big hand was around her wrist before she could pull it away. “Please.”

“Take your hand off me.”

“Please, Lineh, just hear me out. What I feel—”

“*Take your hand off me!*”

Lineh tried to pull her arm away but Tarseech pulled back. He jumped to his feet, which caused his chair to slide backwards on its little wheels and sent him crashing into her, knocking her to the ground. She screamed for help and lashed out with a free hand, catching him hard enough across the nose to make him howl in pain. He clutched at his face and felt wetness there – blood.

“You fucking bitch!” he screamed. Lineh was trying to crawl out from under him but he was too quick for her. The pain in his nose was explosive, blinding. “My fucking... You fucking bitch!”

To force her down he grabbed both her shoulders and shook her until her head cracked against the hard, tiled floor.

That whack on the head changed something in Lineh, the way she moved. It hadn’t knocked her unconscious, but her struggles were suddenly uncoordinated, weak. A part of Tarseech noticed this, but by now he was so angry he didn’t care. Thinking about his nose, thinking she had maybe broken it, he swung a backhanded slap into her face that didn’t even draw a cry of pain from her. Then he put his hands around her throat.

It took more pressure than he’d expected. He really had to squeeze, had to endure the feeling of cartilage bending and shifting under his grip. It was revolting. It sickened him. He gritted his teeth and bore that unpleasantness for what felt like a long, long time.

---

\noindent It was an hour later.

Tarseech hadn’t moved from where he had been sitting. He simply stared down at the face of the woman in front of him. Sometimes he wept, hugging himself and rocking back and forth like a frightened child. For the rest of the time he just sat there, looking at her, in silence.

From her walking in, surprising him, to her final moments alive, he wondered how much time had passed. Had the episode lasted even five minutes? Three? How could a life end so quickly? How could a life – his life – change so much in less time than it took to drink a coffee?

It seemed impossible that a mistake over such a short span of time couldn’t simply be undone. Press control-Z until he was back at the point where Lineh walked in, and then take it from there. Start over.

He looked again at the still and cooling body in front of him, and knew there was no going back. Only forwards.

With shaking hands, he took out his mobile, and dialled a number. He listened to it ring. Eventually it went to voicemail, as Tarseech had expected it would. The man on the other end didn’t want to hear from him. No matter: he was prepared.

“It’s an emergency,” he said, shortly. “It concerns you. Call me.”

*That* would get his attention.

The call-back didn’t take long. When the phone started to vibrate it was *his* turn to play the waiting game. He stood up slowly, stiff joints complaining, and picked up the glass that was sitting there. He drained the last of the whisky before answering. “Yes?”

“Hello?” In the background, Tarseech could hear kitchen sounds: dishes being cleared away. “Did you call me just now?”

“Yes.”

“Who is this?”

“You know who it is.”

A brief pause. The sound of options being weighed.

“All right, old Asram,” Ebri Hoz said, coldly cordial. “Didn’t we agree it was best if we didn’t talk at all any more? Well, no matter. What’s on your mind?”

“I have a problem. Here at the office.”

“What sort of problem?”

“I’m looking at her right now.”

There was a long silence on the line. Tarseech let it drag out.

“You know people, Hoz,” he went on. The whisky was burning inside him, giving him confidence. It felt good. He was invincible. “Don’t tell me you don’t. People who can *clean things up.* Make things *disappear.*”

“Don’t you say another word over the phone, you piece of shit,” Hoz hissed.

“You’ve got to help me, Hoz,” Tarseech insisted. “You *will* help me. You have to.”

“Don’t you dare tell me what to—”

“Remember what I *know,* Hoz!” It came out as something like a scream, loud enough to shut Hoz up and make him listen. “I need you tonight, but you need me forever, remember?” Tarseech let that sink in for a moment. “And before you even think it, because I know that’s how your mind works: forget about making *me* disappear. I’ve got protection. People I trust to hold on to an envelope without opening it. If I step under a bus or something, you’re finished. Understand? So don’t even try it.”

This was a lie, and Hoz probably didn’t believe it. But the silence on the other end of the line stretched out long enough for Tarseech to know Hoz was thinking things through. Tarseech waited.

“All right, Asram,” Hoz said, after a while. “Old friend. What exactly do you need?”

## IV

It was the second time this week that Malaf had been arrested, and, looking at things dispassionately, she had to say she liked it better this time around.

While her recent adventures had hardly made her an expert, she did feel that the onboarding process at Ez Raam Central Prison was slicker, more adroitly run than at the local Guard station. The only break in the smooth flow of things was when a young man, evidently new at the job, didn’t know how to work the fingerprint scanner.

“You have to turn it on first,” Malaf told him.

“You think I didn’t try that? The damn button doesn’t work.”

“There’s a power switch at the back too,” she pointed out.

The man frowned at her, letting her know he wasn’t in the mood to play games here. Then, looking a little sheepish, he reached behind the machine and switched it on.

“It *is* hard to see,” Malaf reassured him, and presented her right hand for scanning.

Perhaps the only difference this time was that she was making things easier for the people checking her in: changing into the gown provided, looking up into the camera for a photo, facing front, facing right. It was a familiar process by now, and she complied with it without complaint. There didn’t seem to be much reason to put up a fight.

It had been a shock to emerge from the van to find herself in the underground car park of Ramestan’s most notorious jail. This was where they sent the political prisoners: the journalists, spies, bloggers, poets, activists. Some were released after years of confinement without trial. Others died falling down stairs, or of previously undiagnosed heart trouble, days before their official release dates.

Malaf didn’t know what it meant that they had sent her here, instead of some nondescript Guard station. Perhaps, she thought, it was so she could be quietly and speedily executed. But then again: why wouldn’t a Guard station suffice? Surely they too were well equipped for such procedures.

---

\noindent Unsmiling men in uniform led her to a small, windowless room without a bed and locked her in it. The cell was too small to pace around in, so she sat on the floor with her back against the wall, eyes closed, not really thinking about anything in particular. Mentally she explored the sensations fed back by her own body. The pain in her cheek from where she’d been punched. The cuts and bruises all over the rest of her body. The tiredness in her muscles from running. She wondered, without much curiosity, how long it had been since she had last eaten.

After an unknowable period someone came to unlock the door.

“Sagheedi.”

Her voice croaked when she tried to speak. “Yes?” she coughed.

“Stand up.”

Malaf nodded and got stiffly to her feet. The man held out a pair of handcuffs, and she offered him her bare wrists.

---

\noindent She was led along a corridor that smelled of new plaster. All the lights were too bright.

She passed through heavy security gates that clearly led deeper into the prison. On the other side, things were actually quieter: the background hum of admin vanished with the slam of a soundproofed door. The walls ate sound.

After that, a long walk down more corridors. With a crackle that made her jump, a set of concealed speakers came to life somewhere in the ceiling. A man’s voice – garbled, barely recognisable as human – reminded them all that God was great, then faded into silence.

“Through here,” one of her attendants instructed her. He was pointing to an unmarked white door, which his partner was in the process of unlocking.

“What’s inside?” Malaf asked.

“No talking!” the man with the keys snapped, and raised an arm as if to hit her; she flinched away, saying nothing.

Behind the door was another windowless room, recently painted a clean white that gleamed under the bright lights. Malaf wondered if they were underground. The room was empty except for two things: the customary portrait of the Supreme Leader, encased in thick clear plastic; and a single metal chair bolted to the floor. She noticed, with growing alarm, that the chair’s legs had thick leather straps on it at ankle-height.

“Sit down.”

Malaf’s reluctance earned her a hard shove from behind. She sat on the hard metal chair. One man kept a restraining hand on the top of her head, forcing her to look down as his friend fastened the straps around her legs. When she was securely tied they stepped away.

“What is this?” Malaf asked.

“No talking.”

The two men left through the same door, leaving Malaf alone with the Supreme Leader. She could feel the portrait’s eyes on her. She stared back at it. She thought: *come on, man, aren’t you dead yet?*

They left her there, tied to her chair, for what felt like a long time but was probably no more than a few minutes. The feel of the restraints sent panic through her whenever she tried to move. She knew that this was the whole point: to make her frightened enough to talk. She fought to keep calm, but when she heard the sound of something heavy banging against the door from the outside, the shock sent her heart rate soaring.

After the thud: muffled cursing and the sound of keys in the lock. The door opened, and the same two men came in. One of them was carrying a heavy metal object, long and awkward; he looked at his colleague as if annoyed he wasn’t getting any help moving it.

Malaf watched as the thing was set down in front of her. The two men appraised it silently, hands on hips. Then one of them began to unfold its long legs, and Malaf saw that it was some sort of tripod.

Without saying a word to her the men left again, leaving the tripod where it stood.

A few minutes later they were back, the same man carrying more equipment. He looked red-faced and out of breath: he must have had to bring it up some stairs. Malaf watched with growing puzzlement as they continued with their work, unfolding the new part and slotting it into the top of the tripod. The whole thing, fully assembled, held a tall, broad rectangle of white fabric that unrolled from a cylinder at its top and reached almost down to the floor. It looked exactly like a projector screen.

They looked at the screen and decided they needed to reposition it. Working together they lifted it up and placed it so that it was between Malaf and the door. When they were satisfied, they stepped behind it, and Malaf heard but did not see them leave.

By now she was too confused to be frightened. Was this some new torture technique? Were they going to bore her to death with slide shows? She turned her head but could see nowhere a projector might be concealed – unless the Supreme Leader could shoot light beams from his eyes or something. She decided that this was unlikely.

More waiting. She started counting in her head. It gave her something to do. She had just passed two hundred when the door opened again, unseen.

In the acoustically brittle space around her every noise could be discerned. The clicks of wood on tile as a stool was placed behind the screen. Shuffling footsteps. The swish of fabric. A sigh as stiff knees bent. The door closing softly.

There was someone else in the room with her.

The man behind the screen – and from the sounds he had made walking in, Malaf was certain it *was* a man – said nothing for a long time. Malaf saw no need to make the first move.

When the man spoke, his voice was flat and quiet.

“You are Qoshoor Sagheedi’s only daughter,” he said. “Your name is Malaf Sagheedi.”

Malaf made no reply.

Her interlocutor must have interpreted her silence as a nod. “Do you know how much danger your actions have put you in? You have broken countless laws. There is no reason at all for you to leave this place alive.”

Malaf thought: *and yet here we are, talking...*

“There are ways you can improve your situation,” the man told her. “Depending on how you answer my questions. Do I need to remind you what will happen to you here if you lie to me?”

By now she had identified the voice. How could she not? It was on the radio so often. Another piece of information that slotted between the others.

“Why are you here?” the man asked Malaf. “Why am I talking to you? Convince me that I am not wasting my time with you.”

Malaf was silent for a long moment.

“When I was arrested,” she said, quietly, “there was a tape recorder. There was something on it. A single, long recording. It would have lasted over an hour. Did you listen to it?”

“It seemed to contain nothing of importance.”

Meaning: explain it to me.

Malaf lay her hands on her lap, fingers interlaced. She took a long, slow breath. The story in her head had never been spoken out loud before. She needed a moment to compose herself, to put her thoughts in order.

“The last few minutes of the recording relate to a murder,” she began. “Lineh Parkiesh was an employee of RaamCo Construction Finance. She was murdered by her manager, a man named Asram Tarseech. Tarseech was in love with her, obsessed with her. It began with giving her gifts. Later she suspected he was following her, waiting outside her house, watching her.

“She wasn’t killed in her house,” Malaf said. “I suspect it happened in her office. She went there, late one evening, taking her laptop with her. I knew she did this because her laptop wasn’t in her home when I illegally entered it the other day.”

If the confession provoked a reaction from behind the screen, Malaf didn’t hear it. She went on.

“So: Tarseech killed Lineh. If he wanted to get away with it, he would need something to say that would lead any investigation in the wrong direction. Eventually he would cook up a story in which she’d confessed to him a secret boyfriend. It would be a good story. In this story, Lineh would be heartbroken, and would have run away to be alone for a while – long enough to confuse anybody trying to work out a time of death. All of that was his long term plan. In the short term, he needed to move a body, and he needed an alibi. It had to come from someone powerful enough to make sure the police didn’t get too diligent; someone he could trust not to turn him in. And there was one man he knew he could trust: Ebri Hoz.”

The sound was tiny: a creak of joined wood as the stool flexed microscopically to bear the weight of a centre of gravity that had shifted ever so slightly forward on its seat.

“Go back several years,” Malaf said. “Ebri Hoz has had his eye on the Presidency for a long time. He knows plenty of people who might support him politically, but what he lacks is the funds to run a campaign.”

She was saying nothing the other person didn’t already know, but it was *her* story and, in a way, this was *her* moment. She would not be hurried.

“As I said, Hoz is good at making contacts. He knows everyone. He knows people on the board of the oil and gas firm PetRaam. That’s how he finds out about a big government-sponsored project to open six oil rigs across Ramestan. The plan had been sitting un-acted upon for years, but is ready to kick off. All the government has to do is hand over the cash and construction can begin. To do this, they require the services of RaamCo Construction Finance, and a man named Asram Tarseech. I don’t know who approaches whom, but eventually a plan is worked out: work together and steal the money.

“Probably Tarseech wasn’t that big a player. His cut of the loot can’t have been big: I don’t see him riding around in a private jet or anything. But he was central to the whole scam. And it *was* a scam: a scam run with the blessing of the Ramestani government. The oil rigs’ funding was shifted around and around until it could get past the West’s sanctions. All Tarseech had to do was add one more layer of deception, and the cash simply disappeared. The government was angry, of course, but didn’t want to admit to having been so easily swindled. They could have pursued it openly, but decided to keep quiet and pretend the whole thing had never happened.

“Of course, it won’t have been *just* Tarseech. Something this big would require layers and layers of people. Corrupt bureaucrats. Board members of the companies involved. I’ve seen documents that could tell you some of the names.” Malaf took a slow, long breath. “Your own investigations must have hinted at some of the names already, *Imam Boraqashti*.”

No sound issued from behind the screen. No further words were offered in that unique and instantly identifiable rasping voice. The silence was confirmation enough; Malaf pressed on.

“Years pass. The oil rig sites remain empty scraps of desert. The only sign that there was ever any interest in them are a few bits of rubbish left behind by the original surveyors, and a handful documents in some RaamCo storage facility that didn’t get shredded properly. Documents that, years later, someone found, and decided to bring out into the open. That woman was Lineh Parkiesh. Sick of a job she hated and a boss who obsessed over her, and with past sins for which she wished to atone, she copied the paperwork and sent it to people who planned to publish it anonymously online. On the night she disappeared, I think her plan was to bring back even more: that’s why she had her laptop with her.

“I don’t know if that’s why she was killed. We may never know what happened that night. But from what Tarseech said, the way he acted when I spoke with him, I don’t think he suspected a thing. I think Lineh’s death was a random event, stupid and sad.

“I enter this story when Lineh disappeared,” Malaf went on. “She and I... We were...” Her voice caught. She fought down the emotions, put them away behind the mask she wore. She started again. “We’d had an argument and she didn’t want to speak with me. I wouldn’t let it go. I thought she was avoiding me, and she probably was. But the more I looked, the more I began to think that something bad had happened to her. I learned that Tarseech had killed her – not with the kind of evidence you could use in court, but enough for me. And *he* knew that I knew. Which is why he called on his old friend Hoz again.

“God only knows what Hoz will be capable of if he becomes President, but right now he doesn’t have the clout to send a squadron of Guards after me. All he had was the phone numbers of two bargain basement hit men. Perhaps they were the ones who moved Lineh’s body for Tarseech. They came for me in my apartment but they didn’t find me. What they *did* find was the name of the place I’d chosen to hide in: Ez Nezeshti, the site of one of the missing oil rigs. When Hoz found out, he sent them to Ez Nezeshti to kill me. Later I came back to Ez Raam. They didn’t.”

Malaf paused for a moment. She wished she had a glass of water.

“Which brings me to *you,*” Malaf said. “The fact that you’ve had the Guards chasing me tells me you’ve suspected some of this all along. Your feelings towards Ebri Hoz are well known. No doubt you have spies and intelligence officers watching him. Of course you’re tapping his phone, but he must know that and have his own secret channels. So that’s something I don’t know: what put you on to me?”

Behind the opaque screen, Boraqashti was silent. When the voice came, it was low and dangerous. “From the geologist. Khesri. The messages you left him.”

Malaf nodded slowly. “Ros Khesri. He’d been hired as a consultant when PetRaam first scoped the sites for oil rigs. When the government re-opened the Hydrocarbon Extraction Project, they needed his sign-off to say his report was still valid. I don’t see how it wouldn’t have been: what’s a few years to a geologist? But Tarseech knew Khesri had the power to say no to the whole thing. Why take the chance? So he wrote a letter in Khesri’s name, signed it without even checking what his real signature looked like. A dumb move. The fake signature ended up on the documents Lineh discovered. Lineh called Khesri to ask about it, and that pulled him back into the business. After I got back from Ez Raam, I called Khesri to tell him he might be in danger.”

“You were too late.”

Another death. Malaf absorbed this without emotion. It had been a long week.

“Well. My message on Khesri’s phone led you to me. You caught me, and here we are. You ask me why you’re talking to me. It’s an interesting question. Why *are* you talking to me, Imam Boraqashti?”

“There is information you possess,” Boraqashti said from behind his screen. “You have seen the documents Lineh Parkiesh leaked.”

Malaf thought back to it: the printouts sitting on her lap in Qaseh’s car on their drive to Ez Nezeshti. Some reading to pass the time.

“Correct.”

“What did they contain?”

Malaf frowned. Thought.

“I asked you a question, Sagheedi,” Boraqashti stated, a threatening edge to his voice. “What did the documents contain?”

“Maps,” Malaf said, guardedly. “Spreadsheets. Some names.”

“You will tell me these names.”

“I don’t know. Will I?”

The quiet in the room was absolute. Malaf didn’t know whether she was hearing utter, uncontrolled fury, or mere bafflement that someone had defied him. If so, the fury would surely follow, so she spoke quickly and evenly.

“Doubtless you’re preparing to threaten me. Lock me up in here forever. Or torture me. Or torture my father and make me watch. You’re going to say you can make me tell you. And I can confidently say, Imam: you are absolutely right. I would tell you. There’s no way I would hold out. I’d tell you everything, *eventually.*”

Despite her fear, her voice was steady. When she spoke the last word, she paused just long enough to test whether it had hit home.

Silence. It had.

Because right now, Malaf knew, Boraqashti was thinking of the old man in the intensive care unit of Blessed Martyrs. The Supreme Leader might be dead in days, or even hours. When that happened, the political upheaval could be unimaginable. Who would take the Supreme Leader’s place? Everyone who followed Ramestani politics kept a mental list of possible successors. Malaf knew that Boraqashti’s name was on a lot of those lists, maybe not at the top, but within grasping distance of it.

Dirt on certain political figures was never worthless. In other circumstances Boraqashti could have afforded to wait. But if there was information he could use, how much more valuable was it *today?* How much was it worth this hour, this *minute?*

A scraping noise, high-pitched like a scream. Wood on tile. The stool being shifted backwards.

Malaf watched as a man shuffled out from behind the screen. He stood there, black-robed against the white, back bent. He looked at Malaf briefly, then broke eye contact to look around himself, as though seeing the room he was in for the first time. He seemed not to know what to do with his hands. When Boraqashti spoke, his voice was a mumble she struggled to hear.

“Do you know where you are?” he asked her.

The question surprised her. “Central Prison,” she answered.

He shot her an irritated glance. “This is *D*-block,” he specified. “Do you know its significance? To *me?*”

Malaf did, but said nothing.

“When I first visited Central Prison,” Boraqashti went on, “this building was much smaller. We had a crowding problem, back then. Dissenters, blasphemers. Mostly students, demanding their so-called ‘rights’. Hundreds every day, it seemed, and gaining momentum.

“We were at war. We were stretched. There were those who thought that if they pushed us, we would break, or at least bend. That we might... *compromise.*” He spat the word, his mouth twisting with disgust. Malaf watched him tremble with the memory, the anger still fresh after so many years.

“We were fighting to the *death,*” he hissed. “We fed young men into the desert until we feared we would have no blood left to shed, and in the midst of that sacrifice, that self-slaughter, *our own citizens* were choosing to betray us.

“And they were *winning.* Parliament was *concerned.* They were *prepared to listen.*” He shook his head, as if this sentence was so incomprehensible that even now he struggled to parse it. “The invading army and falling bombs were *nothing* compared to what we were almost willing to do to ourselves.

“I sometimes wonder what this nation would be like if Parliament had had its way,” Boraqashti mused. “If I had not intervened when I did. Would we be overrun by Jews and homosexuals by now? Women walking around unveiled like American whores? I *had* to act. I had to show them that just because we were vulnerable, it didn’t mean we were *weak.*

“And so I acted. I took the initiative and saved our nation. And outside these walls, few are aware of the story of that day.”

Malaf stared at him, bemused by how out of touch Boraqashti was with reality. Of course she knew what had happened: everyone did. The D-block killings, and the wider purge they had initiated, were what had made Boraqashti a household name.

Boraqashti was quiet for a moment. To Malaf it seemed that a reflective, almost wistful look had crept into his eyes. When he recollected the murders, he wasn’t just looking back on the good old days. He was remembering the single most defining moment of his life. And in that instant, Malaf understood what it was that this old man truly craved.

“God gives us few opportunities,” Boraqashti said, quietly, “to serve our purpose so completely. I was given one chance, years ago. I was challenged, and I prevailed, and will forever be grateful for having truly known myself. But perhaps... perhaps today I have been blessed with a second opportunity.”

Malaf felt something cold in her stomach, hard and tight like a fist. She spoke with her mouth dry. Her voice did not shake.

“Nobody benefits from the oil rig scandal coming to light,” she said. “You want to take care of it, but you want to do it in secret. Fine. I will tell you everything I know. I no longer have the documents, but if you want hard evidence, it won’t be hard to find. All you’ll need to do is to...”

Boraqashti waved his hand airily at the word ‘evidence’. It irritated him that she was wasting his time with such details.

“In return,” Malaf went on. “I walk out of here. My father too. None of this follows us, ever. The people Lineh leaked the documents to: I know them. You want this to stay secret? Then let me out of here. Let me send a message. I can tell them to keep quiet as long as I live. They’ll do it, for me. But if I disappear one day...”

Boraqashti gave her a tired look through his bottle-thick spectacles, letting her know how little her threat impressed him; but when Malaf saw that he did not dissent, she continued.

“The other thing...”

The Imam stared at her, astonished at her temerity. Malaf waited until his shy gaze met her own, and held it.

“The other thing I want,” Malaf said, “is this: when Hoz swings, Asram Tarseech swings with him.”

And for the first time in their encounter, Imam Boraqashti seemed satisfied, even pleased, as if he had been expecting her to ask for something unreasonable.

## V

After the death was announced in the national news, a day of mourning was declared. No longer: it did not do to dwell on such things.

The ceremony was held in the Grand Council Hall under a gigantic poster of the Supreme Leader. The portrait was of him shortly after taking office, longer ago than many people realised; for some, it was as if he had always been there. Sternly handsome in his black robes, in his picture he stared out with the confidence of a man who expected to live forever, or at least to outlast anyone looking at him.

The great space was packed, every seat taken. As was traditional, the clergy had their side, the politicians another. They faced off against each other.

And into the centre, shy under the gaze of untold hungry eyes, Imam Raz Boraqashti shuffled his way to the podium.

He had changed his robes from black to mourning white. It gave him an other-worldly look. He blinked under the bright lights shining down on him, and paused to re-settle his grimy steel glasses. There were cameras trained on him; the ceremony was being broadcast live to the nation. The viewers at home would hear his speech perfectly, but those in live attendance knew they might struggle: the old building’s loudspeakers were poorly positioned, and it would be harder for them to hear. Boraqashti would make them hang on every word.

Still, when at last he spoke, it was with a power and volume that took those who knew him by surprise. It seemed, at last, that he had found his voice.

“My friends,” he began. “There are those who have told me that I should feel joy this day. They tell me that this is a great time for all of us; a time of renewal and rebirth for all of us, for the whole of Ramestan. And they are right. But what has brought me here today... it fills me with a sadness I cannot express. To have had this life taken from us...”

He stopped, seemingly overcome with emotion. He brought a handkerchief to the corner of his eye; but neither the television cameras nor the members of audience could see if he was truly weeping.

---

\noindent Other people walked for fun; Shosa Hoz did not. There wasn’t a lot that Shosa Hoz *did* do for anything people would recognise as fun. Recently, however, she had complained to her physician of pain and stiffness in her joints. The man had had the temerity to suggest that a little gentle exercise might alleviate some of the symptoms.

And so she had fitted a short daily walk into her schedule. She was disciplined about it, as she was with all things. Every morning she had her driver take her to a small park near her office. She would then do precisely one circuit of the grassy area, following a path from which she would refuse to deviate. Her driver would walk a little ahead of her, clearing the track of such obstacles as loose branches, small children, and people having picnics whom she would otherwise have crushed underfoot.

It was her ritual, her routine.

Her brother’s security detail had advised her against routines.

---

\noindent “Goddamned *fucking* bastard,” Hoz hissed, looking again at his Swiss watch. “Why today? Why did he have to pick *today?*”

Fazem, who was holding one conversation through a phone held to his ear and thumbing his way through another, via text message, using a mobile in his non-dominant hand, gave Hoz an exasperated look. “They say it’ll be *at most* another five minutes.”

“The little prick said that five minutes ago. Deal with it!”

Fazem showed Hoz his two full hands, as if to say he wished that God had graced him with a third.

Hoz paced the hallway of his mansion on the outskirts of northern Ez Raam. He wished he’d taken Shosa’s advice and moved closer to the city centre. He didn’t much fancy the noise or the air or the *people,* but at least he wouldn’t get screwed every time one of his drivers got sick or went on strike or died. *Had* he died? He would wish he had, Hoz decided. He was about to ask Fazem to make a note to that effect in his agenda – *when President: find driver; murder him; set Ressi and his idiot brother on him, burn the body and shoot any witnesses* – when the doorbell rang.

A flunkey was on standby to get the door, but in his extraordinary haste Hoz took the unusual step of opening it by himself.

“You’re late,” he told the young man who was standing there. “Useless piece of... who are you?”

“My name is Sehri, sir,” the man said with a bow. “Your regular driver sends his apologies, but his—”

“Yes, yes, enough,” Hoz snapped. “Fazem, we’re leaving!”

As they walked to the car, Hoz glanced along his driveway. The other day he’d spotted some people loitering there with cameras. They had taken pictures of him as he’d emerged, trying to get a look through his tinted windows. He hadn’t minded: whether they were spies or journalists, either way it was a sign he was making it. He was making waves. Even before the battle had started, already he was *winning.*

But there was nobody waiting for him this time. Every reporter in the country was interested in only one thing. The very same thing that had made Hoz abandon his plans, cancel all meetings, and make a beeline into the city centre.

The announcement concerning the Supreme Leader.

---

\noindent Tarseech shook a pair of painkillers into his good hand and swallowed them with a swig of whisky. The bottle went back into his desk drawer, which he locked as usual. One couldn’t be too careful.

Even now, days later, he could feel the Sagheedi woman’s teeth sinking into his finger; could feel his flesh rending like cut chicken. He’d looked under the bandage that morning and wondered if the wound might be infected. Should he have gone to hospital? He could have lied and said it was a dog bite. They would have given him stronger meds and dosed him to the eyeballs with antibiotics. Even now he was tempted: who knew what diseases that demented bitch had been carrying?

But if Hoz found out he’d talked to someone, even a doctor... No, Tarseech couldn’t afford that. There had been a time when he had known Hoz would support him. It was what Tarseech had banked on when he’d called that night, asking Hoz for goons to help move Lineh’s body. Taking care of Malaf too... For that second favour he hadn’t dared go to Hoz directly. Better to deal with his sister. Shosa was furious with him, but she was nothing if not pragmatic. She’d seen reason.

Tarseech became aware of a commotion from the main office just outside his door. People arguing. He didn’t know what it meant, and for the moment his hand was throbbing too much for him to care. He tried to find the remote control for the television so he could turn up the volume on the news.

Eventually the shouting from outside became too much for him to ignore. He was just getting out of his chair when the door to his room was yanked open.

Tarseech found himself staring down the length of an assault rifle. He dimly registered a blur of green uniforms somewhere behind it, but naturally it was the gun that concerned him.

“You,” a man barked. “Come with us.”

---

\noindent Boraqashti’s voice croaked with infinite sadness as he went on. He addressed his words to the coffin laid out before him. He stretched out a hand as if to touch the cloth that had been draped over it, to caress it; but it was out of reach.

“On this day, we are reminded of our own frailties. Our inescapable mortality. Our *vulnerability...*”

---

\noindent Hoz couldn’t believe it.

He’d told the driver it was an emergency. A matter of state importance. That he’d have the man’s balls on a skewer if he didn’t get into town in time.

But it seemed there was nothing to be done: they could no more beat Ez Raam’s traffic than break the laws of physics. They had taken the elevated highway, the driver insisting it would save time, and for all Hoz knew, it had done; nevertheless, they were stuck nose to tail with seemingly every other driver in Ramestan.

“God damn it,” Hoz hissed as the car slid to a halt once more. “God damn it! I should have fucking *walked!*”

“I’ll see if I can get them to hold on for another few minutes,” Fazem told his boss as he dialled a number. “I’ll call the station head. Osrat owes you a favour, doesn’t he?”

“Forget about Osrat,” Hoz snapped. “He knows what I’ll do to him if he starts without me. Get me Shosa on the line. Where *is* she?”

Fazem hung up and tried Shosa’s number again. “Still no answer,” he said after a moment. Odd, that: Shosa was *always* there...

While Hoz chewed a fingernail, Fazem looked out of the window, wondering if there was anything else he could do. Without warning his thoughts were interrupted by a crunch of folding metal, and a jolt that ran through the car, jerking them forward.

“What was that?” Fazem asked.

“Oh, *unbelievable,*” Hoz moaned, turning in his seat. He looked through the tinted glass of the back window and raised a middle finger at the driver who’d just rear-ended them.

In the front compartment, the driver was taking off his seat belt. “I’ll take a look.”

“You—” Hoz caught himself, weighing his instinct for swift and merciless revenge against whoever had rammed him, versus the need to get off this highway and in front of a TV camera. Doubtless more damage had been done to the car behind than to his own vehicle, which had thicker armour than many modern battle tanks. Most likely the other car had just bounced off, its bonnet crumpled up like paper without leaving more than a few scratches on Hoz’s paintwork. Still, there was a principle at stake here.

And anyway, his driver had already got out of the car and was jogging around to the back.

While Hoz fumed, Fazem half-stood in his seat to see if he could read the number plate of the car that had hit them. He couldn’t. All he could see was the make of the vehicle: the heavy black model popular with Guard squadrons. He grimaced. *Oh, great,* he thought. *A Guard car.*

He looked around, wondering how long it would be before Hoz realised. Of all rotten bad luck... What were the odds?

*Actually*, Fazem thought, glancing through the front window, *apparently not so low.*

Because it seemed the car in front of them was the same make and model; same colour, even. So, he realised, with the first inklings of alarm, was the one to their left, boxing them in.

He noticed this at approximately the same time that he saw the driver had been carrying a parcel with him in the passenger’s seat. A large, square package wrapped in brown paper. He had left it behind when he’d got out.

“Where the fuck does he think *he’s* going?” Hoz asked, watching the driver run between two stationary vehicles and disappear from sight.

Fazem was about to say something when the package began to make a noise: a vibrating hum, slightly muffled. It lasted for less than half a second – just enough time for Hoz to look up in mild puzzlement.

The explosion blew out all the car’s windows and smashed open the doors, which had been designed to resist impacts coming from *out*side rather than *in.* Heavy armour plating more or less kept the car in shape, although its roof was visibly bowed outward by the blast. Flaming debris was ejected in all directions; it arced out over the edge of the flyover and tumbled, still burning, into the traffic below.

---

\noindent “That we could lose such a great man, with such a great life in politics still ahead of him,” Boraqashti went on, showing Hoz’s coffin his upturned palms, “is a tragedy beyond my ability to express. But for him to have been *murdered...*”

Here his fists clenched, his body quaking with passion.

“*...murdered*,” he said again, “by Imperialist terrorists, here, in our capital city, is truly unthinkable. Our great nation has been penetrated by forces of evil. We have been shown, once more, the need for real leadership, spiritual and otherwise. We have been shown the need for strength. The need for *unity.*”

Boraqashti bowed his head, respectful of the audience’s applause – the first since this ceremony had begun. He did not look up; did not wish to be seen to revel in it.

Instead he kept his eyes fixed on the coffin. It was empty, of course: there hadn’t been enough of Hoz left to scrape together and bury. No matter. This was theatre, and everyone here knew it.

---

\noindent Shosa was approaching the end of her walk when a motorcycle came down the road that ran alongside the park.

In Ramestan it was illegal to ride a motorcycle without proper safety gear, including a helmet with a visor. One would never know this from a survey of road users: the man driving the motorbike, and his passenger on the pillion seat behind him, might have been the only ones wearing helmets in Ez Raam.

The visors made it impossible to see their faces.

The motorcycle came up from behind and revved its engine loudly. The noise made Shosa turn around. Up to that point, wrapped as she was in her severe black gown, she could have been anyone.

The moment she showed her face, the driver started the bike moving again at the speed of a mild jog, heading towards her, then slowing as it came past her.

At the instant of their closest approach, the passenger brought his gun up to eye level and shot Shosa Hoz twice in the head. Then the driver gunned the engine and they were hurtling down the street, soon to be lost in traffic.

They were long gone before the screams began.

---

\noindent Initial investigations into Shosa Hoz’s death assumed a political motive, given that it had happened only minutes before the murder, on the other side of the city, of her brother. The fact that they were victims of a coordinated assassination campaign was obvious to anyone. However, after a visit from two Guards in his private office, the chief investigator announced that that line of enquiry would not be pursued. He had been persuaded that the two murders were unrelated.

The police never solved the murder, and it was not reported in the media.

---

\noindent “Unity,” Boraqashti said again, bringing his hands together, fingers meshing, “and strength. As one, my brothers, we *will* prevail.”

---

\noindent That afternoon, a small private aircraft containing eight members of PetRaam’s board of directors missed its scheduled landing at Ez Raam International Airport. It was later found to have crashed in the mountains to the city’s north.

In the weeks following the tragedy, investigators later claimed that the flight data recorder was damaged, making it hard to determine what had happened to the plane. The crash might have been caused by anything: a faulty component, inferior steel quality, human error. It could even have been, some suggested, quietly, a surface-to-air missile, launched from an army base somewhere in the mountains. There was simply no way of knowing.

Naturally there were no survivors.

---

\noindent A Guard van brought Tarseech directly from his office to Ez Raam’s Central Criminal Court. It was unusual in the extreme that his passage through Ramestan’s criminal justice system should be so swift, but an exception had clearly been made in his case. Justice Olaar Koobi, summoned from his home so urgently that he hadn’t even finished his lunch, had been briefed that this was a matter to be dealt with quickly.

Blinking in stunned disbelief, Tarseech was brought before the judge. The charges against him were read out in legalese machine gun staccato: possession of scheduled substances (narcotics/alcohol); illegal cross-border trafficking of scheduled substances (narcotics/alcohol); illegal domestic sale of scheduled substances (narcotics/alcohol).

The prosecution listed the evidence against him. Most of this was secret testimonial that was not read aloud in court. References were made in code to Anonymous Witness One, Discovered Communication Seven, Interview Five and so on. Such voluminous documentary evidence would have taken most judges weeks to grapple with, but Koobi, with his reputation for efficiency, felt confident he could reach a conclusion on the spot. The fact that Tarseech had a secret bank account containing a surprisingly large amount of money of unknown origin certainly helped him make up his mind.

“Has the accused pleaded guilty?” Koobi asked.

“Your honour,” Tarseech stammered, “I have no idea what any of this is—”

Koobi waved his hand, already half-risen to his feet. “By the authority of God and State you are hereby found guilty.”

A charge of drug smuggling did not leave much space for judicial discretion. Under Ramestani law the next steps were clear. Spluttering with bewilderment, Tarseech had to be dragged away.

As though at some tremendous remove – as if he was looking through a telescope at a supernova in some distant, doomed galaxy – he watched himself be transported, not to a police van to be moved to jail, nor even to a temporary holding cell, but simply down two flights of stairs, into a brightly-lit basement, with spotlessly clean tiled floors and careful soundproofing on all the doors. For a space that was below ground level, Tarseech was struck, dully, by how high-ceilinged it was. But of course, it had to be: there needed to be an allowance for the drop.

Following standard practice, Tarseech was ordered to strip to his waist. A minor official with a clipboard made a small note in the box labelled *identifying marks*.

Upper arm right: tattoo.

Description of same: star, five-pointed, orange.

A warden standing next to him read this note as it was written, and in a wisecracking tone of voice suggested that, for completeness, he might add *poorly done,* or *cheap,* or, *looks less like a star than a starfish.*

The glare Tarseech gave him suggested that this was a remark he had heard before.

The wardens led him up to the scaffold. He moved like a man in a dream, unable to comprehend what was happening to him. It was only when the noose went over his head that he seemed to snap out his stunned passivity. He let out a howl, as if realising, suddenly, what had been done to him, and by whom.

No record was made of the condemned man’s last words. The executioners, drawn by lot and working under anonymity, did not know who they were killing, and could not be matched up with a particular death. All they could say – if they were asked, which they never were – was that on a given date they had hanged a man who, moments before the drop snapped his neck, had screamed something concerning *that evil bitch Malaf.*

Malaf, of course, was a common name. There was no way of knowing who he might have meant.

---

\noindent There were other deaths that day. Minor politicians, financiers, technocrats. People in the oil and gas business. People who moved money across borders.

Some died showily, their killers doubly brazen: first by the fact that they did these things wide open and in broad daylight; and then by the fact that when it happened, nobody mentioned it.

To simply kill people, in public, and then, when the echoes of the gunshots had faded, to hear nothing but silence: *that* was power.

Some died in the open, but many more simply disappeared. Didn’t come home. Vanished without trace. Their number was never reckoned.

The desired effect was not that their deaths would send a message. It was merely wished, by whatever powers, that these people cease to be.

---

\noindent Imam Boraqashti waited for the last of the applause to die down before concluding.

“Ebri Hoz’s martyrdom,” he told the audience, “in the service of this great nation, will never be forgotten. He will be dearly missed. Nobody here will ever say I did not respect and love him.”

His eyes darted up and around, quickly, as if searching their faces for confirmation. But he knew he was right: after the events of that day, nobody ever would say it.

Boraqashti turned his eyes to heaven, and now there *were* tears there. He was elevated, transported by the battle he had won. He had done his duty; would go on doing it, no matter what.

He had found a source of rot and corruption, and he had destroyed it. That this rot had been embodied in the upstart Hoz could only have been a gift from the divine. It was, in its way, a miracle. But on a day like this, Boraqashti knew that miracles were indeed possible.

Exultant, he turned.

All eyes followed his gaze upwards.

On its raised platform, the throne was immense: big enough, though one could not see it, for a cylinder of compressed oxygen and a heavy, silent pump. Transparent cabling snaked from beneath its covers to a mask, not worn but in easy reach. Tiny thin wires leading from heart sensors came down the other side. The man sitting there silently was pale and weak-looking, but his eyes were hard as black marble.

The Supreme Leader looked down at Boraqashti, and at Hoz’s coffin, and gave the faintest nod of assent.


\vspace*{50px}

## VI

Malaf jerked awake, heart thumping in her chest. She opened her eyes in darkness and for a few frantic moments did not know where she was.

A full minute passed before her breathing slowed to normal. She lay on the unfamiliar bed and waited for calm to return.

When she opened her eyes again she saw that the room was not completely dark. Daylight crept around heavy curtains. A sound had woken her, but it had not been the pounding of a fist on the door, or a siren, or a gunshot. It was metal on metal: pans and pots rattling.

She smelled fresh bread.

She got out of bed and realised she was still fully clothed. She stripped and used the ensuite’s shower. She pulled a dressing gown off the rail there; it was fluffy, and warm as a hug.

Then, dressed like that, she went downstairs, to where her father was making breakfast.

---

\noindent Malaf had been kept in prison another twenty-four long hours and then been evicted from her cell without any explanation or comment. Her few possessions had been handed over (minus the dictaphone), and just like that she was free to go. Dismissed. Her father had been released at the same time, there being no reason to hold onto one if the other was being let go. Qoshoor Sagheedi had assumed that Malaf was in jail to be used as leverage against him. It was quite a shock to realise that the reverse was true.

A taxi was waiting for them. Slightly alarming, that: the amount of trade they were doing at Central Prison’s doors, even at this time of night. Perhaps the drivers were all government spies, their vehicles wired for sound. The Sagheedis were too tired to care, and climbed into the first one they found.

“Where to?” the driver asked.

Malaf and her father exchanged glances. Qoshoor Sagheedi’s place was closest, so the obvious thing was to go there. But what would Malaf do when they arrived?

She decided that she wouldn’t go back to her own apartment that night. There was no strong reason behind that decision. While an argument could have been made that she wouldn’t have been safe at home, recent events had amply demonstrated how little extra protection her politician father could offer her.

In the end, she found that she just didn’t want to be alone.

And so the taxi dropped them both off at Qoshoor Sagheedi’s house in east Ez Raam. Her father put the samovar on while Malaf made a call to an all-hours locksmith to get a new lock fitted to her apartment’s front door. Later, in the kitchen, Qoshoor Sagheedi poured two glasses of tea. He took his very sweet, like Lineh used to. The memory made Malaf ache.

It was past midnight. It was time to begin.

“All right,” Sagheedi said, rubbing his dry eyes. “Let’s do this, at last.”

Malaf nodded. And then she began to speak. It was a second confession, but not a repeat performance. This time, she told *everything.* About her past. About Ez Nezeshti. About Lineh. About herself.

---

\noindent Malaf pushed the door to the kitchen silently open and watched her father break eggs into a bowl. He looked up at her and smiled, eyes tired but happy.

“Morning, Malaf,” he asked brightly. “Sleep well?”

Malaf considered telling him the truth: that she had dozed fitfully, waking what felt like many times per hour, the tiniest noise sending her into a mortal panic. She and her father were alive only because they weren’t thought important enough to kill. Would that change? Ever?

Would Malaf sleep soundly ever again?

“Pretty well, thanks,” she told him, and took a seat at the table. She poured herself a glass of juice. “Why aren’t you at work?”

“They’ve declared a holiday,” he explained. “Celebrating our Leader’s miraculous return to health. Probably they think if they give us a day off we’ll be too excited to riot.”

“Any news from the riots? In Ez Parz, or wherever?”

“Ez Parz?” Qoshoor Sagheedi raised his eyebrows in mock incomprehension. “There’s been no news from Ez Parz. All we see on TV is celebration and prayer.” He shrugged, and went back to his eggs.

Malaf watched him thoughtfully. He seemed remarkably cheerful, as if wholly untroubled by their conversation late last night. She wondered which was the more likely interpretation: that he had assimilated these new truths about his daughter, and been surprised by them, even shocked, but that, after having slept on it, he had realised that that so unconditional was his love for her that none of it mattered to him as long as she was safe and happy; or that the revelations were so appalling, so incompatible with his vision of his little girl, that he had simply excised and incinerated whatever brain tissue had been exposed to it, and that they would each spend the rest of their lives pretending the events of the last few days had never occurred and that they were still a normal family. She put the odds at around fifty fifty. Only time would tell.

---

\noindent They had been eating breakfast for some time, the topics of conversation carefully neutral, before Qoshoor Sagheedi dropped his bombshell.

He snapped his fingers suddenly, interrupting himself mid-sentence. “Before I forget,” he said, picking something up from the kitchen counter. “This belongs to you, I think.”

In his hand was Malaf’s mobile phone. Malaf looked at it as if at something alien.

“You left it behind at the Grand Astihari,” he explained. “When they told me you hadn’t come to collect it, I sent someone from the hotel to bring it over to your place. You weren’t in, so they gave it to me.”

Malaf took it in both hands. Its screen was black, dead. She asked him, quietly, urgently: “Is the Internet back?”

“Nation-wide, apparently. Now the crisis is over.”

“Excuse me, please,” she said, getting quickly to her feet. She turned and fled the room.

A few moments later she was back, asking, “Do you have a spare charger? It’s urgent.”

---

\noindent In a tunnel-visioned, time-dilated fog, Malaf sprinted upstairs, into her bedroom. She shut the door behind her.

Her hands shook as she plugged the phone charger into the wall. She immediately pressed the phone’s *on* button and nothing happened. Of course it didn’t: it would take time to build up enough juice.

She left the phone on her bed and paced the small room, eyes never leaving its black screen. She was aware of her father, worried for her, waiting on the stairs, wondering whether he should knock on her door. She prayed that he wouldn’t – not yet.

She waited.

When she could take it no longer she knelt by the side of the bed, hit the *on* button again. The screen showed a dangerously low battery, a one-percent charge. Good enough. She pressed the button and held it until it vibrated awake in her hands.

An age, an eternity passed as it came to life. Tested its internal memory. Connected to the Internet. Picked up where things had left off.

A torrent of notifications. News apps announcing the Supreme Leader’s decline and recovery. Messages from friends. Reminders, missed calls, emails from clients. She scrolled through them frantically until she found it.

A vVhisper message.

> **IROOJ R:** @Malaf: Are you there? Please God tell me you are.

The message was a day old. Malaf’s thumbs hammered out a reply.

> **MALAF S:** @Irooj: You’re okay! I’m back in Ez Raam. I’m safe. What happened? Where are you?

The moment she sent it, a flag lit up acknowledging that Irooj had received the message. Had read it. Was typing a reply.

> **IROOJ R:** I’m so glad you’re alive.
>
> **IROOJ R:** I’m here with Tusham. We made it over the border. They arrested us but I don’t think we’re in trouble. They’re letting us keep our phones.
>
> **IROOJ R:** @Malaf: I have terrible news about Qaseh.

Another message arrived. Not text: an icon representing a photo. Malaf tapped the icon. Watched the image download. Watched as the message bounced from server to server around the world: Egypt, Greece, Ukraine, Senegal, each stop adding an extra layer of security and encryption, each layer measured in desperate heartbeats as bit by bit, byte by byte, the photo was carefully, untraceably transmitted.

It arrived. Malaf opened it.

The photo was of Qaseh. It showed him lying down in a hospital bed, hooked up to an intravenous drip.

He was grinning up at her, giving her a thumbs-up.

> **IROOJ R:** It’s a disaster. They say he’ll make a full recovery.

Malaf gasped a laugh. She took the phone and pressed it to her lips, holding it there a long time.

When she checked the screen again, she saw it had a new message, this one from Qaseh. She opened it.

She stared at it, frowning.

It was a block of text, a jumble of letters, all capitals, rather long. It made no sense to her at all.

It had to be some sort of code.

He’d sent the message knowing that Malaf would be able to decipher it. She wondered if it was some kind of substitution code, each letter standing for another. He’d written it using the English alphabet. That in itself was telling: English had letter combinations that made frequency analysis much easier than with Rami. Already she could see double letters. Would that be an L? An S?

But then again: this was Qaseh. Would he really entrust a message to a code so easily broken?

No, the answer was obvious: the substitution cipher would be only the first layer. Its decoded message would not be the final answer, but another, deeper puzzle to solve. It would allude to things only he and Malaf would know. Obscure references to mutual acquaintances, books they both had read as students.

And would *that* be the end of it? Unlikely. Tricksy Qaseh would have come up with something else, another layer of code that was subtler, more fiendish even than that. It would take her hours, maybe days of work to get to the bottom of it and fully appreciate his brilliance in devising such a system.

She looked at the jumble of letters on her screen, unable to keep the smile from her face.

Then she put the phone down, and went to join her father in the kitchen.
